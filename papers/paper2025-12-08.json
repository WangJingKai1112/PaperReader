    "abstract": "We prove a quantitative version of Zhang's fundamental inequality for heights attached to polarizable endomorphisms. As an application, we obtain a gap principle for the Néron-Tate height on abelian varieties over function fields of arbitrary transcendence degree and characteristic zero, extending the result of Gao-Ge-Kühne. We also establish instances of effective gap principles for regular polynomial endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{P}^2$, in the sense that all constants can are explicit. These yield effective instances of uniformity in the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture in both the arithmetic and geometric settings, including examples in prime characteristic."

    "abstract": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis asserts the existence of highly sparse, trainable subnetworks ('winning tickets') within dense, randomly initialized neural networks. However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime."

This explicit expression yields a necessary and sufficient condition for a root $s \\in (-1, 0)$ of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial $b_f(s)$ to be a pole of $Z_{f,\\varphi}$. Unlike the complex case established by F. Loeser (1985), this condition may fail in certain obvious cases -- such as when $f$ is odd or even in $x$, $y$, or $(x, y)$ -- so not all such roots necessarily become poles."

In particle physics, this inverse problem is known as \\textit{unfolding}. In cases with complex instruments, the distortions they introduce are often known only implicitly through simulations of the detector. Modern machine learning has enabled efficient simulation-based approaches for unfolding high-dimensional data. Among these, one of the first methods successfully deployed on experimental data is the \\textsc{OmniFold} algorithm, a classifier-based Expectation-Maximization procedure. In practice, however, the forward model is only approximately specified, and the corresponding uncertainty is encoded through nuisance parameters. Building on the well-studied \\textsc{OmniFold} algorithm, we show how to extend machine learning-based unfolding to incorporate nuisance parameters. Our new algorithm, called Profile \\textsc{OmniFold}, is demonstrated using a Gaussian example as well as a particle physics case study using simulated data from the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider."

In this paper we rigorously justify that the wave packets for the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system can be approximated by solutions of the NLS equation over a physically relevant $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ time scale. Besides the difficulties such as resonances at $k=0$ and $k=\\pm k_0$ and loss of derivatives arising in the modulation approximation problem in the isentropic Euler-Poisson system, new difficulties arise in the non-isentropic case. In the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system, new resonances at wave number $k=\\pm 2k_0$ appear which necessitate rescaling the correction to the modulation approximation differently for different wave numbers. In addition, it is more difficult to obtain the uniform estimates for the error $(R_{0},R_{1},R_{-1})$ between the real solutions and the approximate solutions, due to the extra interactions with the temperature. To overcome the difficulties aroused by resonances and loss of derivatives, we find several important structural identities between the diagonalized unknowns and apply a series of normal-form transforms, to obtain uniform estimates for the error over the desired $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ long time scale."

In the particular case of singular Killing foliations, this leads to a strong constraint under mild topological assumptions: namely, the leaves of such foliations are all closed, provided the Euler characteristic of its ambient manifold is non-vanishing and its singular strata are all odd-codimensional. Next, we relate the basic cohomology of a singular Riemannian foliation with that of its blow-up, generalizing well-known, classical analogous results in algebraic and complex geometry. Finally, we show that the space of leaf closures of a singular Killing foliation is the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of a sequence of orbifolds, whose dimensions are the codimension of the foliation."

    "abstract": "The quantitative impact of strong rotation on the amplitudes and frequencies of the post-bounce gravitational wave (GW) signal from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still not fully understood. To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars."

    "abstract": "Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backboens, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on various dense prediction tasks demonstrate that $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. In addition, it requires less than half the training data previously used and efficiently performs inference in a single step.

    "abstract": "Despite substantial investment in safety alignment, the vulnerability of large language models to sophisticated multi-turn adversarial attacks remains poorly characterized, and whether model scale or inference mode affects robustness is unknown. This study employed the TEMPEST multi-turn attack framework to evaluate ten frontier models from eight vendors across 1,000 harmful behaviors, generating over 97,000 API queries across adversarial conversations with automated evaluation by independent safety classifiers. Results demonstrated a spectrum of vulnerability: six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rate (ASR), while four showed meaningful resistance, with ASR ranging from 42% to 78%; enabling extended reasoning on identical architecture reduced ASR from 97% to 42%. These findings indicate that safety alignment quality varies substantially across vendors, that model scale does not predict adversarial robustness, and that thinking mode provides a deployable safety enhancement. Collectively, this work establishes that current alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn attacks regardless of model scale, while identifying deliberative inference as a promising defense direction."

These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes."

In this work, we demonstrate that this \"Inductive Bottleneck\" is not an architectural artifact, but a data-dependent adaptation. By analyzing the layer-wise Effective Encoding Dimension (EED) of DINO-trained ViTs across datasets of varying compositional complexity (UC Merced, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-100), we show that the depth of the bottleneck correlates strongly with the semantic abstraction required by the task. We find that while texture-heavy datasets preserve high-rank representations throughout, object-centric datasets drive the network to dampen high-frequency information in middle layers, effectively \"learning\" a bottleneck to isolate semantic features."

By assigning stellar particles bias factors that scale with their smoothing lengths, our method boosts photon emission from low-density regions while conserving energy through weight corrections. Tests on a Milky-Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 cosmological simulation show that bias factors proportional to the smoothing length substantially extend the reliable LSB regime, providing an inexpensive improvement for deep synthetic imaging of simulated galaxies."

Our algorithm achieves prior-dependent competitive guarantees and gracefully interpolates between worst-case and fully-informed settings. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates superior empirical performance across diverse scenarios, achieving near-optimal results under accurate priors while maintaining robust worst-case guarantees. This framework naturally extends to incorporate multiple predictions, non-uniform priors, and contextual information, highlighting the practical advantages of Bayesian reasoning in online decision problems with imperfect predictions."

Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing. We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups. Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency.

Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions."

Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $λ_{\\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\\sim 2.7\\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors."

We train a multi-layer perceptron to map noisy measurement vectors to binary defect indicators, achieving accurate and robust recovery even under sparse, bounded perturbations. Beyond accuracy, we show that the trained network implicitly learns the underlying pooling structure that links items to tests, allowing this structure to be recovered directly from the network's Jacobian. This indicates that the model does not merely memorize training patterns but internalizes the true combinatorial relationships governing QGT. Our findings reveal that standard feedforward architectures can learn verifiable inverse mappings in structured combinatorial recovery problems."

    "abstract": "A preliminary study has been conducted on the effects of serration on the leading-edge of a two-element trapezoidal wing placed both out-of- and in-ground effect. Aerodynamic performance and flow behaviour were evaluated numerically and validated experimentally. Results indicate an increase in maximum lift coefficient and stall angle obtained implementing a serrated leading-edge geometry due to the flow being re-energized by the formation of a series of counter-rotating pairs of vortices. Results from the analysis of the wing in ground effect appear less well defined. Both leading-edge geometries -- straight and serrated -- show an increase in efficiency due to the proximity to the ground. The wing with the straight leading-edge geometry shows constant improvement up to stall, whilst numerical results show a significant decrease in lift performance at high angles of attack. This may be caused by the lower-fidelity numerical model implemented at higher angles of attack, thus yielding less accurate results."

These models usually require 3D point clouds from laser scanners that are expensive to acquire and require specialist knowledge to use. In this article, we present a graph generation pipeline based on photogrammetry. The pipeline detects relevant objects and predicts their relation using RGB images and depth data generated by a stereo camera. This more cost-effective approach uses deep learning for object detection and instance segmentation of the objects, and employs user-defined heuristics or rules to infer their relations. Results of two hydraulic systems show that this strategy can produce graphs close to the ground truth while its flexibility allows the method to be tailored to specific applications and its transparency qualifies it to be used in the high stakes decision-making that is required for critical infrastructures."

    "abstract": "The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely."

    "abstract": "This work aims to learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the instantaneous dependencies underlying a multivariate time series. The observed data follow a linear structural vector autoregressive model (SVARM) with both instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies, where the instantaneous structure is modeled by a DAG to reflect potential causal relationships. While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives."

In medical imaging, it can support clinical decision-making, but current models often over-edit.

We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images. SMILE also improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT, raising the F1 score by up to 10 percent."

    "abstract": "Because machine learning has significantly improved efficiency and convenience in the society, it's increasingly used to assist or replace human decision-making. However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods."

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing."

Even with the promotion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the process of tumor delineation is difficult and time-consuming, which is prone to inter-observer error. In order to overcome these limitations, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on SqueezeNet v1 which is a lightweight model, and EfficientNet-B0, which is a high-performing model, and is enhanced with handcrafted radiomic descriptors, including Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters and Wavelet transforms. The framework was trained and tested only on publicly available Nickparvar Brain Tumor MRI dataset, which consisted of 7,023 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MRI slices which were categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The testing accuracy of the model was 98.93% that reached a level of 99.08% with Test Time Augmentation (TTA) showing great generalization and power. The proposed hybrid network offers a compromise between computation efficiency and diagnostic accuracy compared to current deep learning structures and only has to be trained using fewer than 2.1 million parameters and less than 1.2 GFLOPs. The handcrafted feature addition allowed greater sensitivity in texture and the EfficientNet-B0 backbone represented intricate hierarchical features. The resulting model has almost clinical reliability in automated MRI-based classification of tumors highlighting its possibility of use in clinical decision-support systems."

Moreover, to maintain semantic alignment for general knowledge transfer while encouraging the diverse representations that dropout introduces, we further propose residual entropy regularization. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show our method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios like low-shot learning, long-tail classification, and out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, our method surpasses regularization-based methods including KgCoOp by 5.10% and PromptSRC by 2.13% in performance on base-to-novel generalization."

To address this issue, we propose ReLKD, an end-to-end framework that effectively exploits implicit inter-class relations and leverages this knowledge to enhance the classification of novel classes. ReLKD comprises three key modules: a target-grained module for learning discriminative representations, a coarse-grained module for capturing hierarchical class relations, and a distillation module for transferring knowledge from the coarse-grained module to refine the target-grained module's representation learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLKD, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12."

The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts."

Clifford algebra allows the Spin and Pin groups to fully analyse calibrations and a new calibration is created that derives the Fano volume, which provides a visualisation of the complete subalgebra structure of sedenions. This new 15-dimensional calibration, along with the existing one containing 35 quaternions, enables an explicit derivation of the automorphisms of sedenions matching Schafer's result and hence addresses a discrepancy in the literature. Also, Gresnigt has suggested extending Furey's work on quark and lepton families using octonions to three octonion subalgebras of sedenions. The Fano volume allows this process to avoid the power-associative subalgebras of sedenions. It is conjectured that Fano hyper-volumes will uncover the complete subalgebra structure of all Cayley-Dickson algebras."

    "abstract": "While surrogate backpropagation proves useful for training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), incorporating biologically inspired local signals on a large scale remains challenging. This difficulty stems primarily from the high memory demands of maintaining accurate spike-timing logs and the potential for purely local plasticity adjustments to clash with the supervised learning goal. To effectively leverage local signals derived from spiking neuron dynamics, we introduce Dopamine-Modulated Spike-Synchrony-Dependent Plasticity (DA-SSDP), a synchrony-based rule that is sensitive to loss and brings a synchrony-based local learning signal to the model. DA-SSDP condenses spike patterns into a synchrony metric at the batch level. An initial brief warm-up phase assesses its relationship to the task loss and sets a fixed gate that subsequently adjusts the local update's magnitude. In cases where synchrony proves unrelated to the task, the gate settles at one, simplifying DA-SSDP to a basic two-factor synchrony mechanism that delivers minor weight adjustments driven by concurrent spike firing and a Gaussian latency function. These small weight updates are only added to the network`s deeper layers following the backpropagation phase, and our tests showed this simplified version did not degrade performance and sometimes gave a small accuracy boost, serving as a regularizer during training. The rule stores only binary spike indicators and first-spike latencies with a Gaussian kernel. Without altering the model structure or optimization routine, evaluations on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (+0.42\\%), CIFAR-100 (+0.99\\%), CIFAR10-DVS (+0.1\\%), and ImageNet-1K (+0.73\\%) demonstrated consistent accuracy gains, accompanied by a minor increase in computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in medical image classification. However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones. For an input image, we first compute cubical persistence diagrams (PDs) across multiple image resolutions/scales. We then develop a ``vineyard'' algorithm that consolidates these PDs into a single, stable diagram capturing signatures at varying granularities, from global anatomy to subtle local irregularities that may indicate early-stage disease. To further exploit richer topological representations produced by multiple filtrations, we design a cross-attention-based neural network that directly processes the consolidated final PDs. The resulting topological embeddings are fused with feature maps from CNNs or Transformers. By integrating multi-scale and multi-filtration topologies into an end-to-end architecture, our approach enhances the model's capacity to recognize complex anatomical structures. Evaluations on three public datasets show consistent, considerable improvements over strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the value of our comprehensive topological perspective for robust and interpretable medical image classification."

Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''. The total equation of state parameter hints towards the presence of a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at $z\\approx 0.66$, corresponding to the transition from matter to dark energy dominance. Early Universe dynamics, derived from the slow-roll parameters, spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are found to be perfectly consistent with observations from Planck 2018 and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope."

Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

The analysis employs a unified improved Langevin transport model that incorporates both collisional and radiative energy loss, followed by coalescence plus fragmentation hadronization.

The $30-50\\%$ centrality data provide significantly stronger constraints than the $0-10\\%$ data. The extracted ratio $\\hat{q}/κ$ between the quark jet transport and heavy-quark diffusion coefficients exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, deviating from the value $2$ estimated from the definition, with a value interval spanning 0.25--0.8 corresponding to the mean values of the inferred parameters. This work establishes a data-driven quantitative relationship between these two fundamental transport properties in the same observables, offering crucial insight into their interplay in the strongly coupled medium."

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics and clustering of dust particles with inertia in shock-dominated compressible turbulence using the two-dimensional, stochastically forced Burgers equation. At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments."

    "abstract": "Precise modeling of extended sources is a central challenge in modern optical engineering, laser physics, and computational lithography. Unlike ideal point sources or completely incoherent thermal radiation sources, real-world light sources -- such as high-power laser diode arrays, superluminescent diodes (SLD), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources, and beams transmitted through atmospheric turbulence -- typically exhibit partial spatial coherence. Traditional geometric optics based on ray tracing ignores diffraction and interference effects; while classical wave optics is accurate, the computational cost of handling four-dimensional correlation functions for partially coherent fields is enormous. To balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy, phase space optics provides a unified theoretical framework. By introducing the Wigner distribution function (WDF), we can map the light field into a joint space-time-spatial frequency domain $(\\bm{r}, \\bm{p})$. This description not only retains all the information of wave optics (including interference terms) but also naturally transitions to the ray description of Hamiltonian optics in the short-wavelength limit, governed by Liouville's theorem of phase space volume conservation. This report aims to establish optimal modeling methods based on phase space and Hamiltonian optics for different types of extended sources such as partially coherent light, fully coherent light, and quasi-homogeneous light. The report will derive in detail the mathematical models for each source type and provide strict criteria for the applicability of geometric optics models using mathematical tools such as the Moyal expansion and generalized Fresnel number."

Our main result is an operator-algebraic characterization: complex self-testing is equivalent to uniqueness of the real parts of higher moments, leading to a basis-independent formulation in terms of real C* algebras. This leads to a classification of non-local strategies, and a tight boundary where standard self-testing do not apply and complex self-testing is necessary. We further construct a strategy involving quaternions, establishing the first standard self-test for genuinely complex strategy. Our work clarifies the structure of complex self-testing and highlights the subtle role of complex numbers in bipartite Bell non-locality."

Accurate characterization of brain tissue microstructure is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of cancer. By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f(α) vs α curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection."

To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features.

In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure. Building upon our previous work, we extend the analysis of projected (2-d) alignment angles to facilitate more direct comparisons with recent observational studies. In our methodology, galaxy orientations are estimated using optical position angles derived from synthetic DESI-LS and Euclid images, while BH spin vectors serve as proxies for AGN jet directions. From a carefully selected sample of 100 BH-galaxy systems at low redshift, we generate a catalog of 5,000 mock optical images using a Monte Carlo approach that samples random viewing angles and redshifts. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for AGN jets to align with the orientation of their host galaxies, consistent with recent observations combining Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and optical imaging of nearby AGNs. Furthermore, we find a slightly stronger alignment when using kinematic position angles derived from synthetic MaNGA-like stellar velocity fields. These findings underscore the importance of combining morphological, kinematic, and polarimetric information to disentangle the complex interplay between black hole spin evolution, accretion mode, and the galactic environment in shaping the direction of relativistic jets."

Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications."

These efficiently computable structural features derive from constrained graph colorings where each triangle uses exactly two colors, forbidding monochromatic and rainbow triangles, a constraint arising in distributed systems where components avoid complete concentration or isolation. For theta graphs Theta_n, we prove r_k(Theta_n) = S(n-2, k-1) for k >= 3 (Stirling numbers of the second kind) and r_2(Theta_n) = 2^(n-2) + 1, computable in O(n) time. For fan graphs Phi_n, we establish r_2(Phi_n) = F_{n+1} (Fibonacci numbers) and derive explicit formulas r_k(Phi_n) = sum_{t=k-1}^{n-1} a_{n-1,t} * S(t, k-1) with efficiently computable binomial coefficients, achieving O(n^2) computation per component. Unlike classical chromatic polynomials, which assign identical features to all n-vertex 2-trees, bichromatic constraints provide informative structural features. While not complete graph invariants, these features capture meaningful structural properties through connections to Fibonacci polynomials, Bell numbers, and independent set enumeration. Applications include Byzantine fault tolerance in hierarchical networks, VM allocation in cloud computing, and secret-sharing protocols in distributed cryptography."

Recent advances including AgroNT and PDLLMs have made notable progress although, they suffer from excessive parameter size and limited ability to model the bidirectional nature of DNA strands respectively. To address these limitations, we propose PlantBiMoE, a lightweight and expressive plant genome language model that integrates bidirectional Mamba and a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) framework. The bidirectional Mamba enables the model to effectively capture structural dependencies across both the forward and reverse DNA strands, while SparseMoE significantly reduces the number of active parameters, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing modeling capacity. We evaluated and tested our model on the Modified Plants Genome Benchmark (MPGB), an enhanced genomic benchmark, which consolidates 31 datasets across 11 representative tasks, with input sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 6,000 bp. Experimental results demonstrate that PlantBiMoE achieves the best performance on 20 out of 31 datasets and the average best when comparing with existing models. In summary, all above results demonstrate that our model can effectively represent plant genomic sequences, serving as a robust computational tool for diverse genomic tasks, while making substantive contributions to plant genomics, gene editing, and synthetic biology.

Experimental results are compared with high-fidelity axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations. Results demonstrate regime transition in the parameter space, across the unsteadiness boundary, all the way from shear-layer breakdown to shock system oscillations and ultimately to large-amplitude pulsations. The dominant mode in the experiments and the simulations corresponds to a Strouhal number St ~ 0.17 for small oscillations reducing to St ~ 0.13 for large pulsations.

In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence."

While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features. We evaluate our method on the in-the-wild HolyScenes dataset and demonstrate that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and efficiency."

We quantify the maximum benefit of a dependency-aware approach for batch workloads. We model the problem as a flexible job-shop scheduling variant and use an offline solver to compute upper bounds on carbon and energy savings. Results show up to $25\\%$ lower carbon emissions on average without increasing the optimal makespan (total job completion time) compared to a makespan-only baseline. Although in heterogeneous server setup, these schedules may use more energy than energy-optimal ones.

We show that the revenue-optimal stage-2 rule is the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves (VCG) mechanism, while stage-1 transfers implement the optimal screening of types and absorb information rents consistent with incentive compatibility and participation. By committing to VCG ex post, the pre-auction information game becomes a potential game, so equilibrium information choices maximize expected welfare; the stage-1 fee schedule then transfers an optimal amount of payoff without conditioning on unverifiable cost scales.

For the GO model, we showed that a spatially flat universe inevitably evolves toward a big rip singularity. At the same time, the inclusion of spatial curvature modifies the expansion rate without removing the finite-time divergence: positive curvature speeds up the formation of the singularity, whereas negative curvature induces transitions between quintessence, de Sitter, and phantom-like regimes. When Kaniadakis entropy corrections are incorporated, the qualitative behavior changes substantially. The modified HDE density admits a stable de Sitter critical point and evolves toward a little rip singularity, in which the Hubble rate diverges only at infinite cosmic time. We further demonstrate that spatial curvature acts solely as a quantitative deformation in this scenario. Although it alters the detailed expansion history, it does not alter the little-rip character of the future singularity. Our results reveal that the asymptotic fate of holographic cosmologies is highly sensitive to the underlying entropy-area relation: the GO model robustly predicts a big rip. At the same time, its Kaniadakis deformation consistently softens the singularity into a little rip, even in curved universes."

The reasoning LLMs tested do not eliminate these deficits, indicating that thought strings may not be able to fully address the discrepancy between model internal state and behavior. Additionally, we find that LLMs appear to be more sensitive to incoherence resulting from an event that violates the setting (e.g., a rainy day in the desert) than to incoherence arising from a character violating an established trait (e.g., Mary, a vegetarian, later orders a cheeseburger), suggesting that LLMs may rely more on prototypical world knowledge than building meaning-based narrative coherence. The consistent asymmetry found in our results suggests that LLMs do not have a complete grasp on narrative coherence."

    "abstract": "Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment in real-world applications. This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "We propose an experimental apparatus to reveal the quantum coherence manifested in downward quantum jumps of amplitude bistability. The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade."

We demonstrate that such parity-odd harmonics are related to their parity-even counterparts through the action of a `Chern-Simons operator', which we present as a novelty in this paper. This relation leads to the construction of simultaneous eigen-functions of the Laplacian and the Chern-Simons operators. Subsequently, these harmonic functions are employed to construct propagators in pure abelian Chern-Simons theory as well as Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in a covariant gauge. We demonstrate the consistency of the Chern-Simons propagator with the expected two-point function of the boundary currents. Our results are built upon the embedding formalism, which we modify suitably to incorporate parity-odd structures. This formalism also readily helps us write down parity odd structures for the propagators of higher-spin fields. Finally, we construct a split representation for the parity-odd harmonic functions, which may be useful to compute Witten diagrams with loops. Our results are expected to be useful in perturbative studies of parity violating QFTs on AdS$_3$."

To address the lack of fine-grained reward supervision in longhorizontal reasoning tasks, we propose Geometric Policy Optimization (GeoPO), which introduces tree-structured sampling and step-level reward estimation with geometric consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialDreamer delivers highly competitive results across multiple challenging benchmarks, signifying a critical advancement in human-like active spatial mental simulation for MLLMs."

The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a \"plateau\" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a \"plateau\" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau."

Our approach represents each day as a TTE sequence by discretizing time into grid-based tokens. Unlike previous methods primarily dependent on temporal dependency from historical patterns, our method leverages streaming contextual information to predict departures. Evaluation on a real-world study involving 93 users and passive smartphone data demonstrates that our method effectively captures irregular departure patterns within individual routines, outperforming baseline models. These results highlight the potential for practical deployment of the \\ours algorithm and its contribution to sustainable transportation systems."

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks."

Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation. This work establishes temporal magnonics as a new paradigm for reconfigurable, lithography-free spin-wave control."

We show that shear-free solutions with perfect fluid, as well as static vacuum solutions, exist for all topologies. Moreover, we prove that, aside from non-rotationally-symmetric Bianchi II models, all BKS metrics isotropize in the presence of a positive cosmological constant, and that recollapse is never possible when the weak energy condition is satisfied. This contrasts with General Relativity (GR), where these two properties fail for Bianchi IX and KS metrics. No additional parameters compared to GR are required for these results.

We present here a new approach to fully integrate the coupling into a Hamiltonian, therefore allowing for a conservative description, which, by design, guarantees both energy and momentum conservation. By coupling a fast EAM potential to a highly accurate ACE potential, we verify numerically the conservation properties and show that one can achieve - dependent on both the potential and the atomistic system - a speedup of one or two orders of magnitude compared to a pure ACE simulation."

This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."

Our main results are as follows: (1) The speed distributions of blueshifted spicules and NBPs both exhibit distinct peaks, whereas that of redshifted spicules is monotonically decreasing. (2) Torsional motions of spicules inferred from alternating signs of Dopplershifts are faster than the NBPs' transversal motions by a factor of $10-10^2$, which may imply the mass density ratio in two different heights as $10^2-10^4$. (3) Blueshifted spicules are found to be more abundant than redshifted spicules in general, but their relative population difference reduces to ~10% at Doppler speeds above 35 km s$^{-1}$. (4) Redshifted spicules lying at higher heights share morphological and dynamical similarity with the blueshifted spicules, which implies the same driving mechanism operating in both directions. (5) These two populations appear above NBPs concentrated under the AIA 193 A bright region. We interpret these results in favor of a scenario that Alfven waves generated by NBPs motions impart their energies to spicules in both torsional and field-aligned motions, and also contribute to the coronal heating and possibly the acceleration of the solar wind."

These are expected to reduce the non-turbulent background plasma transport to acceptable neoclassical levels while removing nearly all collisionless direct orbit losses of alpha particles. Yet, alpha particles under resonant conditions can be very sensitive to collisions, causing concerning energy losses and damaging plasma facing components. For the passing alphas such resonances can happen near rational surfaces in the presence of helical error field departures from quasisymmetry that change the magnetic field direction and magnitude. The cancellation between streaming motion and tangential drift of the alphas enhances the effective collision frequency, allowing the formation of a collisional boundary layer and giving rise to a perturbed distribution function. We develop an analytical model to illustrate and evaluate the resonant plateau transport this mechanism causes by formulating a drift kinetic treatment. The results indicate the associated energy losses can become significant in the vicinity of rational surfaces at values of q=m/n when error fields with poloidal and toroidal numbers m and n are present. In addition, we investigate the validity of the quasilinear approximation to the energy flux to show that it imposes a restriction on the error field amplitude that can be considered."

We focus on the primitive variant, where each relay observes a noisy version of the source signal and forwards a compressed description over an orthogonal, noiseless, finite-rate link to the destination. Compress-and-forward (CF) is particularly effective in this setting, especially under oblivious relaying where relays lack access to the source codebook. While neural CF methods have been studied in single-relay channels, extending them to the two-relay case is non-trivial, as it requires fully distributed compression without any inter-relay coordination. We demonstrate that learning-based quantizers at the relays can harness input correlations by operating remote, yet in a collaborative fashion, enabling effective distributed compression in line with Berger-Tung-style coding. Each relay separately compresses its observation using a one-shot learned quantizer, and the destination jointly decodes the source message. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, trained end-to-end with finite-order modulation, operates close to the known theoretical bounds. These results demonstrate that neural CF can scale to multi-relay systems while maintaining both performance and interpretability."

Using an exact head-tail decomposition, we prove that the output error factorizes as $\\|\\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\\|_2=τ\\|μ_{\\mathrm{tail}}-μ_{\\mathrm{head}}\\|_2$ with $τ=\\mathrm{TV}(P,\\hat P)$, yielding a new head-tail diameter bound $\\|\\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\\|_2\\leτ\\,\\mathrm{diam}_{H,T}$ and refinements linking the error to $\\mathrm{Var}_P(V)$. Under an i.i.d.

Experiments on bert-base-uncased and synthetic logits confirm the predicted scaling of $k_\\varepsilon/n$ and show that certified Top-$k$ can reduce scored keys by 2-4$\\times$ on average while meeting the prescribed total-variation budget."

Notably, $\\mathrm{La}_4 \\mathrm{Ni}_3 \\mathrm{O}_{10}$ features a mixed Ni valence state and an asymmetric trilayer configuration, leading to distinct quasiparticle distributions and local density of states (LDOS) between the inner and outer NiO$_2$ planes. In this work, we investigate impurity-induced states in $\\mathrm{La}_4 \\mathrm{Ni}_3 \\mathrm{O}_{10}$ using a two-orbital model combined with $T$-matrix formalism, focusing on the contrasting roles of intra- and interlayer pairing channels. Our self-consistent mean-field analysis reveals that interlayer pairing results in partially gapless Fermi surfaces, with unpaired quasiparticles concentrated in the outer layers and a pronounced low-energy LDOS. We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position. These findings suggest that single-impurity spectroscopy can serve as a powerful probe to distinguish between competing superconducting pairing mechanisms in trilayer nickelates and highlight the rich physics arising from their multilayer structure."

Quantum expectation values are usually calculated via Hilbert space inner products and, thereby, differently from expectation values in classical mechanics, which are weighted phase-space integrals. It is shown that, by using Anti-Wick quantization to associate dynamical variables with self-adjoint linear operators, quantum expectation values can be interpreted as genuine weighted averages over phase space, paralleling their classical counterparts. This interpretation arises naturally in the Segal-Bargmann space, where creation and annihilation operators act as simple multiplication and differentiation operators. In this setting, the Husimi Q-function - the coherent-state representation of the quantum state - can be seen as a true probability density in phase space. Unlike Bohmian mechanics, the present approach retains the standard correspondence between dynamical variables and self-adjoint operators while paving the way for a classical-like probabilistic interpretation of quantum statistics."

Compared to the Cauchy problem, the initial-boundary value problem requires establishing non-standard weighted estimates and handling the unavailability of boundary conditions for higher-order terms. Our approach addresses these challenges via the conormal space technique."

Across all tasks, RL-trained models outperform their corresponding base models, although the degree of improvement differs by benchmark. Our parametric analysis offers practical guidance for RL-based LLM training. Increasing the group size in GRPO and DAPO leads to more stable training dynamics and higher accuracy, while the impact of the KL-penalty coefficient is non-monotonic.

We then investigate morphisms and isogenies between triangular t-modules, provide a characterization of triangular isogenies, and describe the algebra of endomorphisms, including a criterion for commutativity.

We predict that its ground state decays via $6p$ emission to the ground state of $^{14}$O, with a decay energy $E_{6p} = 10.125$ MeV and a width of 371~keV. A $2^+$ state is predicted at 1.7 MeV, comparable with that in $^{18}$Mg, indicating the disappearance of the $Z=14$ magic number in $^{20}$Si. Instead, analyses of the many-body configurations and the average occupancies of the mirror states suggest the presence of $dynamic$ TES in low-lying states of $^{19}$Al/$^{19}$C and $^{20}$Si/$^{20}$C. Further evidence is provided by analyzing the contributions of different components of the GSM Hamiltonian. Moreover, this study offers the first theoretical description of $^{20}$Si and guidance for future experiments."

The proposed approach incorporates physical priors, an edge detector and a mean curvature term, into a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, aiming to combine the interpretability and boundary-smoothing advantages of variational partial differential equations (PDEs) with the strong representational ability of deep neural networks. The architecture consists of two collaborative modules: an F module, which conducts efficient frequency domain preprocessing to alleviate poor local minima, and a T module, which ensures accurate and stable local computations, backed by a stability estimate. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves a balanced trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, which yields competitive quantitative results and improved visual quality compared to pure convolutional neural network (CNN) based models, while achieving performance close to that of transformer-based method with reasonable computational expense."

    "abstract": "Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation method in which the switching angles and levels of a switching signal are computed via an offline optimization procedure to minimize a performance metric, typically the harmonic distortions of the load current. Additional constraints can be incorporated into the optimization problem to achieve secondary objectives, such as the limitation of specific harmonics or the reduction of power converter losses. The resulting optimization problem, however, is highly nonconvex, featuring a trigonometric objective function and constraints as well as both real- and integer-valued optimization variables. This work casts the task of OPP synthesis for a multilevel converter as an optimal control problem of a hybrid system. This problem is in turn lifted into a convex but infinite-dimensional conic program of occupation measures using established methods in convex relaxations of optimal control. Lower bounds on the minimum achievable harmonic distortion are acquired by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs via the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy, where each semidefinite program scales in a jointly linear manner with the numbers of permitted switching transitions and converter voltage levels."

    "abstract": "A central pursuit in theoretical chemistry is the accurate simulation of photochemical reactions, which are governed by nonadiabatic transitions through conical intersections. Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for constructing the necessary potential energy surfaces, but applying it to excited states faces a fundamental barrier: the cost of generating high-level quantum chemistry data. We overcome this challenge by developing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that achieve multi-state multi-reference perturbation theory accuracy through various techniques, such as transfer, multi-state, and $Δ$-learning. Applied to the methaniminium cation, our highest-fidelity transfer-learning model uncovers its complete photodissociation landscape following S$_2$ photoexcitation. The comprehensive XMCQDPT2/SA(3)-CASSCF(12,12) electronic structure description captures all competing decay channels, including S$_1$ branching into photoisomerization and direct H$_2$-loss pathways. Our results show that the population dynamics generally depends on the MLIP model, correlating with its performance. At the same time, the introduction of MLIP-uncertainty corrections based on the predictions of an ensemble of models brings different approaches into agreement, validating this metric as essential for reliable dynamics. To interpret the population dynamics, we introduce a wavepacket oscillation model - a mechanistically transparent, power-law kinetics framework that extracts state-specific lifetimes directly from first-principles simulations. The model quantitatively reproduces the ultrafast decay, creating a direct link between quantum transition probabilities and classical rate constants. The kinetic fits yield channel-specific lifetimes, supporting the recently discovered photochemical pathway mediated by a novel $σπ^*/S_0$ conical intersection."

Meanwhile, measurements of the diphoton signal strength of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson -- potentially modified by loop contributions from triplet-like Higgs states -- are in good agreement with the SM expectation, with combined experimental uncertainties currently at approximately 8\\%. Given the trend in previous measurements, it is expected that future precision Higgs measurements at the HL-LHC and a future lepton collider such as CEPC, FCC-ee, or Muon Collider will be consistent the standard diphoton signal strength, albeit with significantly reduced uncertainties, down to about 0.7\\%. Presuming this and considering all relevant constraints, we explore whether such increasingly precise diphoton measurements can indirectly probe the parameter space that currently evades direct searches. We find that sub-percent-level determinations of the diphoton rate will decisively probe a substantial fraction of this otherwise elusive region."

This requires inferring nearly $90^\\circ$ viewpoint gaps from image sources with severely foreshortened facades and flawed textures, causing state-of-the-art reconstruction engines such as NeRF and 3DGS to fail. To address this problem, we propose two design choices tailored for city structures and satellite inputs. First, we model city geometry as a 2.5D height map, implemented as a Z-monotonic signed distance field (SDF) that matches urban building layouts from top-down viewpoints. This stabilizes geometry optimization under sparse, off-nadir satellite views and yields a watertight mesh with crisp roofs and clean, vertically extruded facades. Second, we paint the mesh appearance from satellite images via differentiable rendering techniques. While the satellite inputs may contain long-range, blurry captures, we further train a generative texture restoration network to enhance the appearance, recovering high-frequency, plausible texture details from degraded inputs. Our method's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale urban reconstruction. For example, in our teaser figure, we reconstruct a $4\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$ real-world region from only a few satellite images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing photorealistic ground views. The resulting models are not only visually compelling but also serve as high-fidelity, application-ready assets for downstream tasks like urban planning and simulation."

The present work demonstrates the manifestation of ion migration in two ways via Hoke and Schottky effects. Both effects are induced by external exposure but have its peculiar way of solar cell performance degradation. We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness. A thick transport layer blocks losses of charge-carrier selectivity in a solar cell and leads to an enormous increase of T80 time, from 15 seconds up to 60 minutes."

However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method."

    "abstract": "The overall neural network (NN) performance is closely related to the properties of its embedding distribution in latent space (LS). It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings."

    "abstract": "Recent text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have achieved impressive visual quality, yet they often suffer from geometric inconsistencies that undermine the structural realism of generated scenes. One prominent issue is vanishing point inconsistency, where projections of parallel lines fail to converge correctly in 2D space. This leads to structurally implausible geometry that degrades spatial realism, especially in architectural scenes. We propose ControlVP, a user-guided framework for correcting vanishing point inconsistencies in generated images. Our approach extends a pre-trained diffusion model by incorporating structural guidance derived from building contours. We also introduce geometric constraints that explicitly encourage alignment between image edges and perspective cues. Our method enhances global geometric consistency while maintaining visual fidelity comparable to the baselines. This capability is particularly valuable for applications that require accurate spatial structure, such as image-to-3D reconstruction.

Such methods for determining chaos as Poincaré sections and spectral methods have been compared. The relationship between the Poincaré sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been estimated. The sample includes 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite, as well as new refined average distances, have been used. The following, most realistic, bar parameters have been adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the major semi-axis of the bar model in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid is 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis is $25^o$, rotation velocity is 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc $^{-1}$. The result of the study is that a 100\\% correlation between the classification by Poincaré sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been established. Consequently, the classification by Poincaré sections can be replaced by a more visual analysis of the amplitude spectra of the orbits. Thus, two lists of GCs: with regular and chaotic dynamics have been compiled. The GCs with varying degrees of orbital chaos have separately been distinguish."

Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data."

This derivation uses elementary concepts of infinitesimal calculus. Second, we derive the relativistic version of Binet's equation for the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter metric. This derivation, which is novel, directly relates the coordinates involved in Binet's equation without the need to introduce potentials or the use of Killing vectors. Finally, we tackle some controversies related to the role of the cosmological constant in the trajectory of photons in a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter or even in Reissner-Nordström-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes."

To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit\" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing. Furthermore, we introduce a RoPE alignment strategy that leverages these reasoning tokens to ensure motion alignment and enable length extrapolation beyond the training duration. We demonstrate that with a minimal data cost of only 50k video pairs, VideoCoF achieves state-of-the-art performance on VideoCoF-Bench, validating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "In the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, its applications span across diverse fields, relying heavily on effective data processing and model optimization. Combined Regularized Support Vector Machines (CR-SVMs) can effectively handle the structural information among data features, but there is a lack of efficient algorithms in distributed-stored big data. To address this issue, we propose a unified optimization framework based on consensus structure. This framework is not only applicable to various loss functions and combined regularization terms but can also be effectively extended to non-convex regularization terms, showing strong scalability. Based on this framework, we develop a distributed parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to efficiently compute CR-SVMs when data is stored in a distributed manner. To ensure the convergence of the algorithm, we also introduce the Gaussian back-substitution method. Meanwhile, for the integrity of the paper, we introduce a new model, the sparse group lasso support vector machine (SGL-SVM), and apply it to music information retrieval. Theoretical analysis confirms that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is not affected by different regularization terms and loss functions, highlighting the universality of the parallel algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and free music archiv datasets demonstrate the reliability, stability, and efficiency of the algorithm."

Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems."

We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems."

A technique for studying the attractors of such systems is proposed. It is shown that delay plays a key role in the emergence (disappearance) of deterministic chaos in the Miles-Krasnopolskaya system. Quantitative changes in the value of the delay can lead to qualitative changes in the types of attractors of the system. So, regular attractors can turn into chaotic ones and vice versa. Also, a change in the delay value can lead to the implementation of new scenarios, both transitions from regular attractors to chaotic ones and transitions from a chaotic attractor of one type to a chaotic attractor of another type."

However, enabling them to \"forget\" designated information remains challenging, especially under privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing unlearning methods largely optimize for efficiency and scalability, yet they offer little transparency, and the black-box nature of GNNs makes it difficult to verify whether forgetting has truly occurred. We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift. We evaluate two backbones (GCN, GAT) and four unlearning strategies (Retrain, GraphEditor, GNNDelete, IDEA) across five benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Coauthor-Physics). Results show that Retrain and GNNDelete achieve near-complete forgetting, GraphEditor provides partial erasure, and IDEA leaves residual signals. These explanation deltas provide the primary, human-readable evidence of forgetting; we also report membership-inference ROC-AUC as a complementary, graph-wide privacy signal."

    "abstract": "The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfvén speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfvén waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it \"cuts across\" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations."

However, while many deep learning models excel at this task, their high computational requirements often limit their practical application in real-time monitoring systems. To address this limitation, a lightweight model based on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is proposed for microseismic event classification, leveraging its inherent resolution-invariance and computational efficiency for waveform processing. In the STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD), a global and large-scale database of seismic waveforms, the FNO-based model demonstrates high effectiveness for trigger classification, with an F1 score of 95% even in the scenario of data sparsity in training. The new FNO model greatly decreases the computer power needed relative to current deep learning models without sacrificing the classification success rate measured by the F1 score. A test on a real microseismic dataset shows a classification success rate with an F1 score of 98%, outperforming many traditional deep-learning techniques. A combination of high success rate and low computational power indicates that the FNO model can serve as a methodology of choice for real-time monitoring of microseismicity for induced seismicity. The method saves computational resources and facilitates both post-processing and real-time seismic processing suitable for the implementation of traffic light systems to prevent undesired induced seismicity."

In this study, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze the size and shape of 643 canid crania spanning the past 50,000 years. Our analyses show that a distinctive dog morphology first appeared at about 11,000 calibrated years before present, and substantial phenotypic diversity already existed in early Holocene dogs.

We focus on the Generalized Projected Gradient Descent (GPGD) framework, which unifies traditional sparse recovery methods and modern approaches using learned deep projective priors. We extend previous convergence results to robustness to model and projection errors. We use these theoretical results to explore ways to better control stability and robustness constants. To reduce recovery errors due to measurement noise, we consider generalized back-projection strategies to adapt GPGD to structured noise, such as sparse outliers. To improve the stability of GPGD, we propose a normalized idempotent regularization for the learning of deep projective priors. We provide numerical experiments in the context of sparse recovery and image inverse problems, highlighting the trade-offs between identifiability and stability that can be achieved with such methods."

    "abstract": "In recommender systems, user-item interactions can be modeled as a bipartite graph, where user and item nodes are connected by undirected edges. This graph-based view has motivated the rapid adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), which often outperform collaborative filtering (CF) methods such as latent factor models, deep neural networks, and generative strategies. Yet, despite their empirical success, the reasons why GNNs offer systematic advantages over other CF approaches remain only partially understood. This monograph advances a topology-centered perspective on GNN-based recommendation. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of these models' performance should consider the structural properties of user-item graphs and their interaction with GNN architectural design. To support this view, we introduce a formal taxonomy that distills common modeling patterns across eleven representative GNN-based recommendation approaches and consolidates them into a unified conceptual pipeline. We further formalize thirteen classical and topological characteristics of recommendation datasets and reinterpret them through the lens of graph machine learning. Using these definitions, we analyze the considered GNN-based recommender architectures to assess how and to what extent they encode such properties. Building on this analysis, we derive an explanatory framework that links measurable dataset characteristics to model behavior and performance. Taken together, this monograph re-frames GNN-based recommendation through its topological underpinnings and outlines open theoretical, data-centric, and evaluation challenges for the next generation of topology-aware recommender systems."

The equations under consideration naturally generalize a number of related nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity, and plasma physics. Two- and one-dimensional reductions are described, which lead the studied nonlinear Schrödinger equations to simpler equations of lower dimension or ordinary differential equations (or systems of ordinary differential equations). Using methods of generalized and functional separation of variables, a number of new exact solutions of two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations of the general form are found, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions. To analyze the equations under consideration, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems are utilized. Special attention is paid to finding solutions with radial symmetry. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving complex nonlinear PDEs of mathematical physics."

The method builds upon equation-driven Galerkin ROMs constructed from vibration modes and modal-derivative companion vectors, while nonlinear reduced tensors are identified from standard finite element outputs. A database of such ROMs is generated over a set of training samples, and all reduced operators-including the linear stiffness matrix, the quadratic and cubic nonlinear tensors, the Rayleigh damping parameters, and the reduction basis-are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). A global reduced basis is obtained through a two-level POD compression, combined with a MAC-guided reordering strategy to ensure parametric smoothness. The resulting PROM preserves the symmetry and polynomial structure of the reduced equations, enabling robust and efficient adaptation to new parameter values. Analytical parameter sensitivities follow directly from the interpolation model. The approach is demonstrated on a parametrically curved panel and a wing-box with geometric variations, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations and enabling substantial reductions in computational cost for parametric analyses."

While CPL serves as a reference parameterization, the Omnipotent and $Λ_{\\rm s}$CDM scenarios were originally proposed as possible solutions to the $H_0$ tension and are selected here because they can yield negative dark energy. These models are examined within a multi-probe framework based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the lensing-ISW bispectrum. By analyzing both two- and three-point Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) correlations, we assess how their late-time dynamics modify the growth and decay of large-scale gravitational potentials compared to the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology. Despite producing nearly indistinguishable CMB angular spectra at high multipoles, these models yield distinctive signatures in the low-$\\ell$ ISW plateau as well as in higher-order statistics related to ISW, highlighting the power of both large-scale CMB anisotropies and higher-order CMB statistics in testing dark energy physics. Our results demonstrate that combining complementary ISW probes provides an effective way to discriminate between dark energy scenarios and will be crucial to determine whether negative or sign-switching dark energy is ultimately favored or disfavored by forthcoming data."

    "abstract": "In quantum technologies, quantum channels are essential elements for the transmission of quantum states. The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map. This relation between these two channels is a preorder, and we try to study its characterization in this work. We also illustrate the implications of our results for the incompatibility of quantum devices through an example."

Both the kinds of tasks browser agents are designed to execute, along with the kinds of information browser agents are entrusted with to fulfill those tasks, mean that vulnerabilities in these tools can result in enormous privacy harm. This work presents a framework of five broad factors (totaling 15 distinct measurements) to measure the privacy risks in browser agents. Our framework assesses i. vulnerabilities in the browser agent's components, ii. how the browser agent protects against website behaviors, iii. whether the browser agent prevents cross-site tracking, iv. how the agent responds to privacy-affecting prompts, and v. whether the tool leaks personal information to sites. We apply our framework to eight browser agents and identify 30 vulnerabilities, ranging from disabled browser privacy features to \"autocompleting\" sensitive personal information in form fields.

In this work, we investigate whether OOD generalisation results generalise. More specifically, we evaluate a model's performance across multiple OOD testsets throughout a finetuning run; we then evaluate the partial correlation of performances across these testsets, regressing out in-domain performance. This allows us to assess how correlated are generalisation performances once in-domain performance is controlled for. Analysing OLMo2 and OPT, we observe no overarching trend in generalisation results: the existence of a positive or negative correlation between any two OOD testsets depends strongly on the specific choice of model analysed."

In this work, we derive the full set of perturbed field equations, impose the quasi-static approximation, and obtain the effective Poisson equation together with the corresponding modified gravitational constant $G_{\\rm eff}$. These ingredients allow us to construct the density contrast evolution equation and analyse the matter growth rate and growth index. Through numerical analysis, we showed that the scalar non-metricity theory is comparable to the well-known $ΛCDM$ model to some extent.

Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons.

Standard approaches including the classical Functional Empirical Process (FEP), break down under such conditions, especially for distributions like Pareto, Cauchy, low degree of freedom Student-t, due to their reliance on finite-variance assumptions to guarantee asymptotic convergence. The TFEP approach addresses these limitations by trimming a controlled proportion of extreme order statistics, thereby stabilizing the empirical process and restoring asymptotic Gaussian behavior. We establish the weak convergence of the TFEP under mild regularity conditions and derive new asymptotic distributions for one-sample and twosample problems. These theoretical developments lead to robust confidence intervals for truncated means, variances, and their differences or ratios. The efficiency and reliability of the TFEP are supported by extensive Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application to Senegalese income data. In all scenarios, the TFEP provides accurate inference where both Gaussian-based methods and the classical FEP break down. The methodology thus offers a powerful and flexible tool for statistical analysis in heavy-tailed and non-standard environments."

Focusing on the partially linear regression (PLR) model, we show that a simple, easily computed condition number for the orthogonal score, denoted kappa_DML := 1 / |J_theta|, largely determines when DML inference is reliable. Our first result derives a nonasymptotic, Berry-Esseen-type bound showing that the coverage error of the usual DML t-statistic is of order n^{-1/2} + sqrt(n) * r_n, where r_n is the standard DML remainder term summarizing nuisance estimation error. Our second result provides a refined linearization in which both estimation error and confidence interval length scale as kappa_DML / sqrt(n) + kappa_DML * r_n, so that ill-conditioning directly inflates both variance and bias. These expansions yield three conditioning regimes - well-conditioned, moderately ill-conditioned, and severely ill-conditioned - and imply that informative, shrinking confidence sets require kappa_DML = o_p(sqrt(n)) and kappa_DML * r_n -> 0. We conduct Monte Carlo experiments across overlap levels, nuisance learners (OLS, Lasso, random forests), and both low- and high-dimensional (p > n) designs. Across these designs, kappa_DML is highly predictive of finite-sample performance: well-conditioned designs with kappa_DML < 1 deliver near-nominal coverage with short intervals, whereas severely ill-conditioned designs can exhibit large bias and coverage around 40% for nominal 95% intervals, despite flexible nuisance fitting. We propose reporting kappa_DML alongside DML estimates as a routine diagnostic of score conditioning, in direct analogy to condition-number checks and weak-instrument diagnostics in IV settings."

Prior work on text-to-UMR parsing is limited to date. In this paper, we introduce two methods for English text-to-UMR parsing, one of which fine-tunes existing parsers for Abstract Meaning Representation and the other, which leverages a converter from Universal Dependencies, using prior work as a baseline. Our best-performing model, which we call SETUP, achieves an AnCast score of 84 and a SMATCH++ score of 91, indicating substantial gains towards automatic UMR parsing."

    "abstract": "Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures have recently garnered significant attention as an emerging solid-state platform for quantum technologies. However, the underlying spin dynamics, and the mechanisms determining the spin-dependent fluorescence in these defects are still poorly understood. In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures. These insights are crucial for further understanding of the spin dynamics of quantum emitters in hBN and their practical implementation in quantum sensing."

The optimized material and tribological properties of Al2219 were also predicted using NSGA II genetic algorithms for multi-objective optimization.

Typically, both D and M are assumed to be exogenous, but this paper allows M to be endogenous while maintaining the exogeneity of D, which holds certainly if D is randomized. The endogeneity problem of M is then overcome using a binary instrumental variable Z. We derive a nonparametric \"causal reduced form (CRF)\" for Y with either (D,Z,DZ) or (D,M,DZ) as the regressors. The CRF enables estimating the direct and indirect effects easily with ordinary least squares or instrumental variable estimator, instead of matching or inverse probability weighting that have difficulties in finding the asymptotic distribution or in dealing with near-zero denominators. Not just this ease in implementation, our approach is applicable to any Y (binary, count, continuous, etc.). Simulation and empirical studies illustrate our approach."

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, thanks to its superior spatial resolution and beamforming gains. In order to realize XL-MIMO costeffectively, an innovative ray antenna array (RAA) architecture with directly-connected uniform linear array (ULA) was recently proposed, which achieves flexible beamforming without relying on traditional analog phase shifters or digital beamforming. However, RAA suffers from the signal blockage issue since its ray-configured ULAs are placed in the same plane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel antenna array architecture termed cylinder directly-connected antenna array (DCAA), which is achieved via multiple simple uniform circular array (sUCA) with carefully designed orientations in a layered three-dimensional structure. The so-called sUCA partitions the uniform circular array (UCA) into two sub-arrays where each sub-array has all antenna elements directly connected to achieve a desired beam direction corresponding to the sub-array's physical orientation, thus achieving full spatial coverage. Compared with the conventional ULA architecture with hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed cylinder DCAA can achieve uniform spatial resolution, enhanced communication rate and lower hardware costs. Simulation results are provided to validate the promised gains of cylinder DCAA, demonstrating its great potential for high-frequency systems such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) systems."

Weak-field optical excitation leads to multiphoton absorption and field emission from the tip apex due to the enhanced local field. The attendant sharp field gradient ensures ponderomotive acceleration of emitted electrons and non-local light-matter interaction. The crossover regime in which simultaneous multiphoton absorption and optical field emission take place is evidenced by the time profile of electron emission correlation, laser power dependence, and polarization angle dependence of each harmonic current."

As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique."

Gas production rates for H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, and CO were $Q_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 3.2\\times10^{26} \\pm 20\\%$, $1.6\\times10^{27} \\pm 10\\%$, $1.3\\times10^{25} \\pm 25\\%$, and $1.0\\times10^{26} \\pm 25\\%$, respectively.

The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM."

    "abstract": "Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) are a popular and efficient type of marine craft that find application in a large number of water-based tasks. When multiple USVs operate in the same area, they may be required to dock to each other to perform a shared task. Existing approaches for the docking between autonomous USVs generally consider one USV as a stationary target, while the second one is tasked to reach the required docking pose. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach for USV-USV docking, where two USVs work together to dock at an agreed location. We use a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to solve the control problem, obtaining feasible trajectories that also guarantee constraint satisfaction. Owing to its model-based nature, this approach allows the rejection of disturbances, inclusive of exogenous inputs, by anticipating their effect on the USVs through the MPC prediction model. This is particularly effective in case of almost-stationary disturbances such as water currents. In simulations, we demonstrate how the proposed approach allows for a faster and more efficient docking with respect to existing approaches."

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the dynamics of similarity classes of tetrahedra generated by the longest-edge bisection (LEB) algorithm. Building on the normalization strategy introduced by Perdomo and Plaza for triangles, we construct a canonical representation of tetrahedra in a normalized space embedded in the product of the hyperbolic half-plane and the hyperbolic half-space model. This representation allows us to define the left and right refinement maps, $Φ_L$ and $Φ_R$, acting on the space of normalized tetrahedral shapes, and to study their iterative orbits as discrete dynamical systems. Using these maps, we show that the orbit of the space-filling Sommerville tetrahedron contains only 4 similarity classes, 3 of which form an attractive cycle corresponding to the orbit of the path tetrahedron. We also show that small perturbations of elements in those orbits still lead to finite orbits. In addition, we study small perturbations of the regular tetrahedron and show that their orbits are also finite. Extensive numerical exploration of orbits for the other types of tetrahedra suggests that the LEB algorithm does not produce degenerating tetrahedra. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for analyzing the shape evolution of tetrahedral meshes and offers a possible route toward an analytic proof of the non-degeneracy property for the tetrahedral partitions generated by the LEB refinements. This property is highly desired in e.g. the finite element methods (FEMs)."

In this work, we explicitly build a topological model of the configuration space of a tethered robot starting from a polygonal representation of the workspace where the robot moves. To do so, we first establish a link between the configuration space of the tethered robot and the universal covering space of the workspace, and then we exploit this link to develop an algorithm to compute a simplicial complex model of the configuration space. We show how this approach improves the performances of existing algorithms that build other types of representations of the configuration space. The proposed model can be computed in a fraction of the time required to build traditional homotopy-augmented graphs, and is continuous, allowing to solve the path planning task for tethered robots using a broad set of path planning algorithms."

    "abstract": "We investigate parametric estimation of the elasticity parameter in the CKLS diffusion based on high-frequency data. First, we transform the CKLS diffusion to a CIR-type one via a smooth state-space mapping and the general Girsanov change of measure. This transformation enables the applications of existing inference tools for CIR processes while ensuring possibilities of transferring the resulting limit theorems back to the original probability space. However, because Feller's condition fails, many existing high-frequency likelihood-based procedures cannot be applied directly, since their discretization schemes approximate likelihood terms involving the reciprocal of the process by Riemann sums that are no longer well-defined once the paths are allowed to hit zero. Instead, we estimate the drift coefficient of the transformed CIR-type model via a procedure based on its positive Harris recurrence, which is valid in the high-frequency regime. Exploiting the drift-elasticity relationship implied by the CKLS--CIR transformation, with the help of an initial estimation, we obtain an estimator of the CKLS elasticity from the CIR drift estimator in the transformed model. This yields a closed-form estimator of the elasticity parameter with an explicit asymptotic variance. We establish its $p$-consistency, stable convergence in law, and asymptotic normality. Finally, we show that stable convergence in law is invariant under equivalent changes of measure, thereby guaranteeing that the Gaussian limit remains invariant under the original measure."

Since then, smartphone system on chip (SoC) platforms have grown more complex, with heterogeneous processor clusters, sub 10 nm nodes, and frequencies over 2 GHz, potentially complicating SCA. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of electromagnetic (EM) SCA on a Raspberry Pi 4, featuring a Broadcom BCM2711 SoC and a Fairphone 4 featuring a Snapdragon 750G 5G SoC. Using new attack methodologies tailored to modern SoCs, we recover ECDSA secrets from OpenSSL by mounting the Nonce@Once attack of Alam et al.

Motivated by use cases such as the EUDI wallet, we survey Android cryptographic implementations and define representative threat models to assess the attack. Our findings show weaknesses in ECDSA software implementations and underscore the need for independently certified secure elements (SEs) in all smartphones."

    "abstract": "Despite impressive advances in agent systems, multi-turn tool-use scenarios remain challenging. It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer."

Small-scale events of this kind were already known, but their observation was occasional or with limited, lower resolution. Solar Orbiter has revealed that small scale, highly impulsive events are everywhere on the quiet Sun, all the time, at even smaller scales. Their similarity with known larger features, are the witnesses that the physical processes causing them are independent of the spatial scales involved. Their highly dynamic property is the signature of energy transfer and/or local dissipation. Their investigation can thus elucidate on the dominant physical processes acting on the solar atmosphere and on the possible role in the origin of the hot solar corona. In this review, we will present a summary of the observational and simulation results on this topic, led by the results from data taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)/High Resolution Imagers (HRIEUV) instrument.

We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios. This work provides a practical pathway toward inclusive speech technology, enabling effective ASR for underrepresented languages without dependence on massive computational infrastructure or proprietary datasets."

    "abstract": "Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) is hindered by two key challenges: **inadequate sign representation** that fails to capture nuanced visual cues, and **sentence-level semantic misalignment** in current LLM-based methods, which limits translation quality. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage **r**einforcing **v**ision-**l**anguage **f**ramework (**RVLF**). We build a large vision-language model (LVLM) specifically designed for sign language, and then combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance translation performance. First, for a sufficient representation of sign language, RVLF introduces an effective semantic representation learning mechanism that fuses skeleton-based motion cues with semantically rich visual features extracted via DINOv2, followed by instruction tuning to obtain a strong SLT-SFT baseline. Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate GRPO into SLT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of GRPO-based optimization in enhancing both translation quality and semantic consistency."

For many applications, however, this assumption is overly restrictive. We develop a general framework for analyzing the convergence of kernel interpolation {beyond the native space}. Let $A(Ω)$ and $B(Ω)$ be Banach spaces with continuous embeddings $\\mathcal{H}_k\\!\\left(Ω\\right) \\hookrightarrow A(Ω)\\hookrightarrow B(Ω)$, assume point evaluation is continuous on $A(Ω)$, and that $\\mathcal{H}_k\\!\\left(Ω\\right)$ is dense in $A(Ω)$. For a nested sequence of node sets $(X_n)_{n\\ge1}\\subsetΩ$ with $\\bigcup_n X_n$ dense, we characterize convergence of the kernel interpolants in the $B(Ω)$-norm for all target functions in $A(Ω)$ via the uniform boundedness of the interpolation operators $Π^{\\,n}_{A,B}:A(Ω)\\to B(Ω)$. This yields a necessary and sufficient condition under which kernel interpolation extends beyond $\\mathcal{H}_k\\!\\left(Ω\\right)$. Specializing to Sobolev kernels of order $τ>N/2$ on bounded Lipschitz domains, we show that every $f \\in C(\\overlineΩ)$ can be approximated in the $L^2(Ω)$-norm by interpolation using quasi-uniform nested centers. Moreover, for a subclass of Sobolev kernels (including integer-order Matérn kernels), we prove that the Lebesgue constant is uniformly bounded on $[a,b]\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ under quasi-uniform centers; within our framework this implies supremum norm convergence of the interpolants for every target functions $f \\in C([a,b])$."

Despite the progress in optimal quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), optimal constructions of qLRCs remain largely unexplored, partly due to the fact that the existing bounds for qLRCs are not sufficiently tight. In this paper, we focus on pure qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction. We provide several new bounds for pure qLRCs and demonstrate that they are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we show that a variety of classical QECCs, including quantum Hamming codes, quantum GRM codes, and quantum Solomon-Stiffler codes, give rise to pure qLRCs with explicit parameters. Based on these constructions, we further identify many infinite families of optimal qLRCs with respect to different bounds, achieving code lengths much larger than those of known optimal qLRCs."

High-energy processes include Bhabha scattering at LEP and future circular electron-positron colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee), direct production at the LHC, and dedicated searches and precision measurements at proposed muon colliders and $μ$TRISTAN. Low-energy observables encompass parity-violating Møller scattering, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and muonium-antimuonium oscillations. Our combined analysis indicates that for a doubly-charged scalar in the $1$-$3$ TeV range, the flavor-diagonal Yukawa couplings to electrons and muons as small as $10^{-2}$ are accessible. Observations of such a doubly-charged scalar would potentially point toward the type-I seesaw mechanism of neutrino masses in the left-right symmetric model with $D$-parity breaking."

The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$α$ and [OIII]$λ$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles.

However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \\textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $σ_8$, and $Ω_{\\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $σ_8$, and $w$. These findings highlight Betti curves -- especially when combined with traditional two-point statistics -- as a promising, interpretable tool for future galaxy survey analyses."

The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $γ$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $γ$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{γ,{\\rm iso}}\\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\\sim5\\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\\sim3\\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a."

By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K.

Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician\" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \\textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a fundamental role in extended reality (XR) applications. As the standards for immersion in XR continue to increase, the demands for SLAM benchmarking have become more stringent. Trajectory accuracy is the key metric, and marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to generate ground truth (GT) because of their drift-free and relatively accurate measurements. However, the precision of MoCap-based GT is limited by two factors: the spatiotemporal calibration with the device under test (DUT) and the inherent jitter in the MoCap measurements. These limitations hinder accurate SLAM benchmarking, particularly for key metrics like rotation error and inter-frame jitter, which are critical for immersive XR experiences. This paper presents a novel continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates auxiliary inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to compensate for MoCap jitter. Additionally, a variable time synchronization method and a pose residual based on screw congruence constraints are proposed, enabling precise spatiotemporal calibration across multiple sensors and the DUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving the precision necessary for comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in XR applications. Furthermore, we thoroughly validate the practicality of our method by benchmarking several leading XR devices and open-source SLAM algorithms.

However, these methods typically estimate the entropy of VQ indices using a static, global probability distribution, which fails to adapt to the specific content of each image. This non-adaptive approach leads to untapped bitrate potential and challenges in achieving flexible rate control. To address this challenge, we introduce a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework based on a VQ Hyperprior, termed HVQ-CGIC. HVQ-CGIC rigorously derives the mathematical foundation for introducing a hyperprior to the VQ indices entropy model. Based on this foundation, through novel loss design, to our knowledge, this framework is the first to introduce RD balance and control into vector quantization-based Generative Image Compression. Cooperating with a lightweight hyper-prior estimation network, HVQ-CGIC achieves a significant advantage in rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative compression methods. On the Kodak dataset, we achieve the same LPIPS as Control-GIC, CDC and HiFiC with an average of 61.3% fewer bits. We posit that HVQ-CGIC has the potential to become a foundational component for VQGAN-based image compression, analogous to the integral role of the HyperPrior framework in neural image compression."

On CaF2, UH2 adopts the fluorite-type structure with a near-[1 1 1] out-of-plane texture, four rotational domains, and a lattice parameter a = 539 +- 3 pm without measurable strain, whereas the Mo-buffered film is polycrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed complete hydrogenation and minimal oxidation. Magnetization and XMCD measurements show ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperatures of 120-130 K and a uranium 5f moment of 0.9 μB/U, dominated by the orbital contribution (μL ~ 1.4 μB, μS ~ -0.5 μB), in a good agreement with GGA+U computations, which otherwise overestimate absolute values of the spin and orbital components. The slightly reduced moment in thinner CaF2-supported films is attributed to surface U(IV) species. These results demonstrate that thin-film synthesis enables stabilization of UH2 and direct probing of 5f magnetism, opening pathways toward higher uranium hydrides and interface-engineered actinide systems."

The results are particularly promising. An average success rate of 55% was achieved to identify optimal solutions within a Mobius Ladder graph comprising 100 vertices. Compared with other alternatives, the femto-second pulse results in significantly higher peak power, leading to more pronounced quantum effects and lower pump power in optical fiber based CIMs. In addition, we have maintained an impressive success rate for a continuous period of 8 hours, emphasizing the practical applicability of CIMs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our research extends to the application of these principles in practical applications such as molecular docking and credit scoring.

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains. Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations."

This feature enables a unified treatment of hadronic matter across vacuum, nuclear and dense astrophysical regimes. This compact review summarizes the key structures of parity-doublet Lagrangians; outlines the mean-field formulation for nuclear and stellar matter; and highlights recent phenomenological and lattice constraints on the chirally-invariant mass. Emphasis is placed on mirror versus naïve chiral assignments; the role of vector interactions in achieving nuclear saturation; and the implications of parity doubling for the equation-of-state of dense matter and neutron-star cooling.

Monitoring of bats specifically can help understand the spread of disease as well as shine light on bat migration patterns, population dynamics, and the impacts of environmental changes on bat colonies. Fixed sensing modalities, such as infrared sensors, cameras, radar, and acoustic detectors, play a pivotal role in tracking and understanding animal behavior. This survey goes over context-informing details about bat biology, and then reviews these fixed sensing modalities, discussing the unique challenges and contributions of each approach. We highlight the coverage, applications, accuracy, and limitations associated with each of these sensing modalities. By synthesizing recent advances, we provide a comprehensive overview to guide future research in this area."

Our method integrates Langevin dynamics for manifold-consistent exploration with proximal optimization for precise mode seeking, achieving a superior balance between reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality across multiple inverse tasks on FFHQ and DIV2K, outperforming state of the art inverse solvers."

The famous Ebenfelt's SOS conjecture asks for the minimum rank of $A(z,\\bar z)\\|z\\|^2$ under the restriction that $A(z,\\bar z)\\|z\\|^2$ is an SOS. Assume that $A(z,\\bar z)$ is bihomogeneous. In the present note, we establish a connection between Ebenfelt's (Weak) SOS Conjecture and the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies. By reformulating the conjecture in terms of lattice semigroups and their associated Newton-Okounkov convex bodies, we transform the problem of finding the minimal rank of a prolonged sum-of-squares polynomial into an extremal problem in convex geometry. In particular, we prove that this minimal rank is attained at the extreme points of a specific Newton-Okounkov body. Furthermore, if $A(z,\\bar z)$ is moreover diagonal, we demonstrate that the relevant extreme points are finitely many rational points, thereby reducing the verification of the conjecture to a computationally tractable problem. This work provides a new tool for attacking the SOS Conjecture."

    "abstract": "Spin qubits in silicon quantum dot arrays are a promising quantum computation platform for long-term scalability due to their small qubit footprint and compatibility with advanced semiconductor manufacturing. However, spin qubit devices face a key architectural bottleneck: the large physical footprint of readout components relative to qubits prevents a dense layout where all qubits can be measured simultaneously, complicating the implementation of quantum error correction. This challenge is offset by the platform's unique rapid shuttling capability, which can be used to transport qubits to distant readout ports. In this work, we explore the design constraints and capabilities of spin qubits in silicon and propose the SNAQ (Shuttling-capable Narrow Array of spin Qubits) surface code architecture, which relaxes the 1:1 readout-to-qubit assumption by leveraging spin shuttling to time-multiplex ancilla qubit initialization and readout. Our analysis shows that, given sufficiently high (experimentally demonstrated) qubit coherence times, SNAQ delivers an orders-of-magnitude reduction in chip area per logical qubit. Additionally, by using a denser grid of physical qubits, SNAQ enables fast transversal logic for short-distance logical operations, achieving 4.0-22.3x improvement in local logical clock speed while still supporting global operations via lattice surgery. This translates to a 57-60% reduction in spacetime cost of 15-to-1 magic state distillation, a key fault-tolerant subroutine. Our work pinpoints critical hardware metrics and provides a compelling path toward high-performance fault-tolerant computation on near-term-manufacturable spin qubit arrays."

We consider a device that applies an initial layer of single-qubit gates, a single transverse-field Ising analog block, and a final single-qubit layer before $Z$-basis readout. The analog block approximates $Z$-diagonal Ising evolution, and we prove that the resulting output distribution is within constant total-variation (TV) distance of an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP) circuit. Our bounds and constructions are established for fully connected as well as bounded-degree hardware graphs, matching a variety of architectures, including trapped-ion, neutral atom, and superconducting platforms. Assuming anticoncentration (which we prove for all-to-all hardware graphs and conjecture for bounded-degree hardware graphs) and an average-case hardness conjecture for the associated complex-temperature Ising partition functions, standard reductions imply that any efficient classical sampler achieving constant TV error collapses the polynomial hierarchy. Our results imply that quantum-supremacy tests are possible on today's quantum annealers, as well as other devices capable of hybrid digital-analog quantum evolution."

We begin by examining four theoretical perspectives on agency, including instrumental, effortful, dynamically emergent, and authorial agency, and analyze how each frames the relationship between agency and creativity. Under each theoretical perspective, we discuss how the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools reshapes these dynamics by altering students' roles in cognitive, social, and creative processes. In the second part, we introduce a theoretical framework for AI agentic engagement, contextualizing agency within specific cognitive, relational, and ethical dynamics introduced by GenAI tools. This framework is linked to the concept of Mini-c creativity, emphasizing personal relevance and self-directed learning. Together, these perspectives support a shift from viewing creativity as product-oriented to understanding it as a process of agentive participation and meaning-making. We conclude with two directions for future research focused on the creative process and performance in AI-assisted learning."

In this paper, we propose Folded Optimizer with Approximate Moment (FOAM), a method that compresses optimizer states by computing block-wise gradient means and incorporates a residual correction to recover lost information. Theoretically, FOAM achieves convergence rates equivalent to vanilla Adam under standard non-convex optimization settings. Empirically, FOAM reduces total training memory by approximately 50\\%, eliminates up to 90\\% of optimizer state memory overhead, and accelerates convergence. Furthermore, FOAM is compatible with other memory-efficient optimizers, delivering performance and throughput that match or surpass both full-rank and existing memory-efficient baselines."

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have extended toward mesh reconstruction and physically-based rendering (PBR), their geometry is still learned from 2D renderings, leading to coarse surfaces and unreliable BRDF-lighting decomposition. To address these limitations, COREA introduces a coarse-to-fine bidirectional 3D-to-3D alignment strategy that allows geometric signals to be learned directly in 3D space. Within this strategy, depth provides coarse alignment between the two representations, while depth gradients and normals refine fine-scale structure, and the resulting geometry supports stable BRDF-lighting decomposition. A density-control mechanism further stabilizes Gaussian growth, balancing geometric fidelity with memory efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that COREA achieves superior performance in novel-view synthesis, mesh reconstruction, and PBR within a unified framework."

As an application, we establish equidistribution of Følner-Kloosterman sums - an extension of classical Kloosterman sums to infinite fields. Unlike the classical case over algebraic closures of finite fields, these averages exhibit an inherent multiplicative asymmetry, revealing new and fundamentally different behavior. Finally, we derive several combinatorial consequences, including results on sum-product phenomena and a Furstenberg--Sárközy-type theorem for Laurent polynomials over general fields."

    "abstract": "Periodic boundary condition (PBC) is a standard approximation for calculating crystalline materials properties. However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle."

    "abstract": "With growing interest in space exploration, optimized airfoil design has become increasingly important. However, airfoil design in rarefied gas flows remains underexplored because solving the Boltzmann equation formulated in a six dimensional phase space is time consuming. To address this problem, a solver-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization framework for symmetric, thickness-only airfoils is developed. First, airfoils are parameterized using a class shape transformation that enforce geometric admissibility. Second, a Gaussian process expected improvement surrogate is coupled in batches to a fast converging, asymptotic preserving Boltzmann solver for sample efficient exploration. Drag minimizing airfoils are identified in a wide range of gas rarefaction. It is found that, at Mach numbers Ma=2 and 4, the streamwise force increases with the gas rarefaction and shifts from pressure dominated to shear dominated drag, while optimization reduces drag at all conditions. The benefit of optimization peaks in the weakly rarefied regime, about 30% at Ma=2 and 40 to 50% at Ma=4, and falls to a few percent in transition and free-molecular flow regimes. Drag decomposition shows that these gains come mainly from reduced pressure drag, with viscous drag almost unchanged. The optimal airfoils form a coherent rarefaction-aware family: they retain a smooth, single-peaked thickness profile, are aft-loaded at low gas rarefaction, and exhibit a forward shift of maximum thickness and thickness area toward mid-chord as gas rarefaction increases. These trends provide a physically interpretable map that narrows the design space."

Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an \"alignment tax\" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities. Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling. Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights. Results: Our experiments demonstrate three breakthroughs. First, High-Precision Profiling: The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.011 against psychological ground truth. Second, Geometric Orthogonality: T-SNE visualization confirms that personality manifolds are distinct and continuous, allowing for \"Zero-Shot Personality Injection\" that maintains original model intelligence. Third, Deterministic Steering: We achieve robust control over behavior via vector arithmetic, validated through extensive ablation studies. Conclusion: This work challenges the necessity of fine-tuning for personalization. By transitioning from probabilistic prompting to deterministic latent intervention, we provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for safe, controllable AI personalization."

    "abstract": "Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) incur high computational costs due to their reliance on hundreds of visual tokens to represent images. While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by \"vanishing token information\", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as \"information horizon\", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations."

A classical issue with the fusion of many embeddings from audio with text is the large length of the audio sequence compared to the text one. Our method benefits from an existing speech tokenizer trained for Audio Speech Recognition that output long sequences of tokens from a large vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate it at low cost in a large language model. By applying a simple lasso-based feature selection on multimodal Bag-of-Words representation, we retain only the most important audio tokens for the task, and adapt the language model to them with a self-supervised language modeling objective, before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. We show this helps to improve the performances compared to an unimodal model, to a bigger SpeechLM or to integrating audio via a learned representation. We show the effectiveness of our method on two recent Argumentative Fallacy Detection and Classification tasks where the use of audio was believed counterproductive, reaching state-of-the-art results. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the method, showing that even a random audio token selection helps enhancing the unimodal model.

In this paper, we present a detailed study on the filament initial eruption under a fan-spine structure. It was found that the filament underwent two distinct acceleration stages corresponding to a calss M1.0 and M4.6 flare event, respectively. The first acceleration stage commenced with the filament splitting, after which the upper portion was subsequently heated being a hot channel and slow rose at an average speed of 22 km/s. A set of hot reverse C-shaped loops appeared repeatedly during the filament splitting and a hook structure was recognized at this phase, suggesting ongoing growth of the magnetic flux rope (MFR). When it reached a certain altitude, the hot channel appeared to get into a quasi-static phase with its upper edge seriously decelerated and lower edge expanding downward. Approximately 30 minutes later, as a distinct annular ribbon appeared outside the hook structure, the hot channel rose again at a velocity over 50 km/s accompanied with rapid footpoints drifting, and experienced the second acceleration stage with its axial flux increased to 1.1 X 10^{21} Mx. It is deduced that the filament initial eruption under a magnetic dome possess multi kinetic process. We suggest that the magnetic reconnection taken place within and beneath the filament continues to trigger the growth of pre-eruptive MFR and the first acceleration, when the magnetic reconnection above the filament plays a key role in the second acceleration."

The first requirement guarantees an exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, while the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than an initial state closer to it. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, there always exists a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from the equilibrium for a given information-theoretic distinguishability measure. We illustrate our findings for the nonunitary dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain and XXZ chain, each weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, showing the quantum Mpemba effect captured by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and trace distance.

In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector or vector time series. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning for dependent time series using a penalized log-likelihood objective function formulated in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform of the time-domain data. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm), local convexity when using non-convex penalties, and graph recovery. We do not impose any incoherence or irrepresentability condition for our convergence results. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on the Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data."

We re-derive the Green--Kubo relation for the spatially resolved linear dielectric response of fluids in planar confinement, explicitly accounting for boundary conditions and showing that equilibrium-derived profiles agree with those obtained from external fields. We identify common misconceptions in the literature and outline how microscopic dielectric behavior can be coarse-grained to connect with experimental observables. Simulations show that water retains a bulk-like dielectric response down to $\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ confinement. The reduced \\emph{effective} dielectric response that governs capacitance arises from the placement of the dielectric interface. Using effective-medium theory, we demonstrate that long-range reductions reported in experiments and theory are consistent with bulk-like behavior beyond about $1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ from the surface. The effective response naturally maps onto an interfacial capacitance, and the dielectric properties of simulated water are robust across simulation setups and water models, reflecting universal polarization correlations."

    "abstract": "As dialogue systems become increasingly important across various domains, a key challenge in persona-based dialogue is generating engaging and context-specific interactions while ensuring the model acts with a coherent personality. However, existing persona-based dialogue datasets lack explicit relations between persona sentences and responses, which makes it difficult for models to effectively capture persona information. To address these issues, we propose MoCoRP (Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response), a framework that incorporates explicit relations into language models. MoCoRP leverages an NLI expert to explicitly extract the NLI relations between persona sentences and responses, enabling the model to effectively incorporate appropriate persona information from the context into its responses. We applied this framework to pre-trained models like BART and further extended it to modern large language models (LLMs) through alignment tuning. Experimental results on the public datasets ConvAI2 and MPChat demonstrate that MoCoRP outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior persona consistency and engaging, context-aware dialogue generation. Furthermore, our model not only excels in quantitative metrics but also shows significant improvements in qualitative aspects. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling persona-response relations in persona-based dialogue.

However, most of those results have not been tested explicitly for reproducibility and might be prone to biases in the study samples or models. Many studies on the topic do not adequately control for genealogical and areal dependencies between sampled languages, casting doubts on the robustness of the results. In this study, we test the robustness of a recent study on sound symbolism of basic vocabulary concepts which analyzed245 languages.The new sample includes data on 2864 languages from Lexibank. We modify the original model by adding statistical controls for spatial and phylogenetic dependencies between languages. The new results show that most of the previously observed patterns are not robust, and in fact many patterns disappear completely when adding the genealogical and areal controls. A small number of patterns, however, emerges as highly stable even with the new sample. Through the new analysis, we are able to assess the distribution of sound symbolism on a larger scale than previously. The study further highlights the need for testing all universal claims on language for robustness on various levels."

We challenge this status quo and propose LIME (Linguistic Metadata Embeddings), a method that enriches token embeddings with metadata capturing syntax, semantics, and contextual properties. LIME substantially improves pre-training efficiency. Specifically, it adapts up to 56% faster to the training data distribution, while introducing only 0.01% additional parameters at negligible compute overhead. Beyond efficiency, LIME improves tokenization, leading to remarkably stronger language modeling capabilities and generative task performance. These benefits persist across model scales (500M to 2B). In addition, we develop a variant with shifted metadata, LIME+1, that can guide token generation. Given prior metadata for the next token, LIME+1 improves reasoning performance by up to 38% and arithmetic accuracy by up to 35%."

To address this, we introduce SPAD. First, we mathematically attribute each token's probability into seven distinct sources: Query, RAG, Past, Current Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the current token. Then, we aggregate these scores by POS tags to quantify how different components drive specific linguistic categories. By identifying anomalies, such as Nouns relying on Final LayerNorm, SPAD effectively detects hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPAD achieves state-of-the-art performance"

Unlike traditional next-token prediction, SJD++ performs multi-token prediction in each forward pass, drastically reducing generation steps. Specifically, it integrates the iterative multi-token prediction mechanism from Jacobi decoding, with the probabilistic drafting-and-verification mechanism from speculative sampling. More importantly, for further acceleration, SJD++ reuses high-confidence draft tokens after each verification phase instead of resampling them all. We conduct extensive experiments on several representative autoregressive text-to-image generation models and demonstrate that SJD++ achieves $2\\times$ to $3\\times$ inference latency reduction and $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ step compression, while preserving visual quality with no observable degradation."

The dipolar atomic species have permanent magnetic dipolar moments. We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution. We finally reveal that miscibility driven by thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures exhibits dipole mode hardening, confirmed by the loss of long-range phase coherence through the correlation function. The mode mixing in the dispersion relations ascertains a dipolar strength-dependent miscibility transition and the low-lying quasiparticle mode evolution."

Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features. It replaces text captions with efficient, fine-grained conditioning, thereby improving generation realism. In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation. Extensive experiments show that S2VC delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with an average 52.73% bitrate saving over prior perceptual methods, underscoring the promise of single-step diffusion for efficient, high-quality video compression."

The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices."

The source for the salt gradient can be as simple as a dissolving ionic crystal, as shown by McDermott et al. [Langmuir 28, 15491 (2012)]. Trapping is due to a competition between localisation due to diffusiophoresis in the salt gradient, and spreading out by diffusion. The size of the trap is typically 1 to 100 micrometres. We further predict that at steady state, the particle (macromolecule) number density is a power law of the salt concentration, with an exponent that is the ratio of the diffusiophoretic mobility to the diffusion coefficient of the trapped species. This ratio increases with size and typically becomes much greater than 1 for particles or macromolecules with hydrodynamic radii of hundreds of nanometres and above. Thus large particles or macromolecules are easily caught and trapped at steady state by salt gradients."

While HDC offers robustness and efficiency on graph-structured data, its fairness implications remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study fairness in graph HDC, where biases in data representation and decision rules can lead to unequal treatment of different groups. We show how hypervector encoding and similarity-based classification can propagate or even amplify such biases, and we propose a fairness-aware training framework, FairGHDC, to mitigate them. FairGHDC introduces a bias correction term, derived from a gap-based demographic-parity regularizer, and converts it into a scalar fairness factor that scales the update of the class hypervector for the ground-truth label. This enables debiasing directly in the hypervector space without modifying the graph encoder or requiring backpropagation. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGHDC substantially reduces demographic-parity and equal-opportunity gaps while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard GNNs and fairness-aware GNNs. At the same time, FairGHDC preserves the computational advantages of HDC, achieving up to about one order of magnitude ($\\approx 10\\times$) speedup in training time on GPU compared to GNN and fairness-aware GNN baselines."

This raises a philosophical question: without a ground-truth next item, does the generative recommendation also holds a potential scaling law? In retrospect, the generative recommendation has two different technique paradigms: (1) ANN-based framework, utilizing the compressed user embedding to retrieve nearest other items in embedding space, e.g, Kuaiformer. (2) Auto-regressive-based framework, employing the beam search to decode the item from whole space, e.g, OneRec.

Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It enables producing coherent, physically plausible, and semantically faithful multi-agent behaviors from only text prompts. Our code and data will be released to facilitate future research."

    "abstract": "Bee populations are declining globally due to habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change, threatening agricultural productivity and food security. While existing smart beehive systems monitor internal conditions, they typically overlook external environmental factors that significantly influence colony health, and are constrained by high cost, limited scalability, and inadequate contextual analysis. We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures both internal hive conditions and external environmental parameters using a cost-effective LoRa-MQTT architecture. Our system deploys modular worker nodes ($\\sim$\\$15 each) equipped with temperature, humidity, light, and GPS sensors both inside and around beehives. A master node functions as a LoRa-MQTT gateway, forwarding data to a cloud server with a mobile application interface. Field experiments confirmed reliable operation with 100\\% packet delivery over 110 meters in line-of-sight conditions and 95 meters in obstructed environments, including successful deployment inside wooden hive structures. Our system demonstrated stable end-to-end latency under 5 seconds and continuous operation over a two-month period across diverse environmental conditions. By bridging the gap between internal and external monitoring, WaggleNet enables contextual anomaly detection and supports data-driven precision beekeeping in resource-constrained settings."

    "abstract": "We study the orbit recovery problem under the rigid-motion group SE(n), where the objective is to reconstruct an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations subjected to unknown rotations and translations. This problem is fundamental in signal processing, computer vision, and structural biology. Our main theoretical contribution is bounding the sample complexity of this problem. We show that if the d-th order moment under the rotation group SO(n) uniquely determines the signal orbit, then orbit recovery under SE(n) is achievable with $N\\gtrsim σ^{2d+4}$ samples as the noise variance $σ^2 \\to \\infty$. The key technical insight is that the d-th order SO(n) moments can be explicitly recovered from (d+2)-order SE(n) autocorrelations, enabling us to transfer known results from the rotation-only setting to the rigid-motion case. We further harness this result to derive a matching bound to the sample complexity of the multi-target detection model that serves as an abstract framework for electron-microscopy-based technologies in structural biology, such as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Beyond theory, we present a provable computational pipeline for rigid-motion orbit recovery in three dimensions. Starting from rigid-motion autocorrelations, we extract the SO(3) moments and demonstrate successful reconstruction of a 3-D macromolecular structure. Importantly, this algorithmic approach is valid at any noise level, suggesting that even very small macromolecules, long believed to be inaccessible using structural biology electron-microscopy-based technologies, may, in principle, be reconstructed given sufficient data."

    "abstract": "We introduce the task of Reconstructing Objects along Hand Interaction Timelines (ROHIT). We first define the Hand Interaction Timeline (HIT) from a rigid object's perspective. In a HIT, an object is first static relative to the scene, then is held in hand following contact, where its pose changes. This is usually followed by a firm grip during use, before it is released to be static again w.r.t. to the scene. We model these pose constraints over the HIT, and propose to propagate the object's pose along the HIT enabling superior reconstruction using our proposed Constrained Optimisation and Propagation (COP) framework. Importantly, we focus on timelines with stable grasps - i.e. where the hand is stably holding an object, effectively maintaining constant contact during use. This allows us to efficiently annotate, study, and evaluate object reconstruction in videos without 3D ground truth. We evaluate our proposed task, ROHIT, over two egocentric datasets, HOT3D and in-the-wild EPIC-Kitchens. In HOT3D, we curate 1.2K clips of stable grasps. In EPIC-Kitchens, we annotate 2.4K clips of stable grasps including 390 object instances across 9 categories from videos of daily interactions in 141 environments. Without 3D ground truth, we utilise 2D projection error to assess the reconstruction. Quantitatively, COP improves stable grasp reconstruction by 6.2-11.3% and HIT reconstruction by up to 24.5% with constrained pose propagation."

Such models have primarily been seen through the lens of interpretability so far, wherein they offer transparency by inferring predictions as a linear combination of semantic concepts. However, a linear combination is inherently limiting. So we propose the enhancement of concept-based learning models through propositional logic. We introduce a logic module that is carefully designed to connect the learned concepts from CBMs through differentiable logic operations, such that our proposed LogicCBM can go beyond simple weighted combinations of concepts to leverage various logical operations to yield the final predictions, while maintaining end-to-end learnability. Composing concepts using a set of logic operators enables the model to capture inter-concept relations, while simultaneously improving the expressivity of the model in terms of logic operations. Our empirical studies on well-known benchmarks and synthetic datasets demonstrate that these models have better accuracy, perform effective interventions and are highly interpretable."

We then derive a matching upper bound for the same risk, showing that the proposed estimator attains the minimax rate when the underlying density belongs to a Sobolev class. Finally, we develop a data-driven version of the procedure that preserves this optimal rate, thus yielding an adaptive estimator. The practical performance of the method is demonstrated through simulation studies."

    "abstract": "Memory effects arise in many complex systems, from protein folding, to the spreading of epidemics and financial decisions. While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems."

    "abstract": "Unlearning in large foundation models (e.g., LLMs) is essential for enabling dynamic knowledge updates, enforcing data deletion rights, and correcting model behavior. However, existing unlearning methods often require full-model fine-tuning or access to the original training data, which limits their scalability and practicality. In this work, we introduce Recover-to-Forget (R2F), a novel framework for efficient unlearning in LLMs based on reconstructing full-model gradient directions from low-rank LoRA adapter updates. Rather than performing backpropagation through the full model, we compute gradients with respect to LoRA parameters using multiple paraphrased prompts and train a gradient decoder to approximate the corresponding full-model gradients. To ensure applicability to larger or black-box models, the decoder is trained on a proxy model and transferred to target models. We provide a theoretical analysis of cross-model generalization and demonstrate that our method achieves effective unlearning while preserving general model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that R2F offers a scalable and lightweight alternative for unlearning in pretrained LLMs without requiring full retraining or access to internal parameters."

We introduce the edge-aware graph attention model, a physics-informed graph neural network tailored for predicting relaxed atomic structures of high-entropy systems. the edge-aware graph attention model employs chemically and geometrically informed descriptors that capture both atomic properties and local structural environments. To effectively capture atomic interactions, our model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism that adaptively weighs neighbouring atoms using both node and edge features. This edge-aware attention framework learn complex chemical and structural relationships independent of global orientation or position. We trained and evaluated the edge-aware GAT model on a dataset of carbide systems, spanning binary to high-entropy carbide compositions, and demonstrated its accuracy, convergence efficiency, and transferability. The architecture is lightweight, with a very low computational footprint, making it highly suitable for large-scale materials screening. By providing invariance to rigid-body transformations and leveraging domain-informed attention mechanisms, our model delivers a fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to DFT, enabling accelerated discovery and screening of entropy-stabilised materials."

As mathematical functions, they are functions on lists that perform combinatorial operations on the representation of the input list. In this paper, we study sorting algorithms conceptually as abstract sorting functions. There is a canonical surjection from the free monoid on a set (lists of elements) to the free commutative monoid on the same set (multisets of elements). We show that sorting functions determine a section (right inverse) to this surjection satisfying two axioms, that do not presuppose a total order on the underlying set. Then, we establish an equivalence between (decidable) total orders on the underlying set and correct sorting functions. The first part of the paper develops concepts from universal algebra from the point of view of functorial signatures, and gives constructions of free monoids and free commutative monoids in (univalent) type theory. Using these constructions, the second part of the paper develops the axiomatisation of sorting functions.

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of MICo, categorizing it into 7 representative tasks and curate a large-scale collection of high-quality source images and construct diverse MICo prompts. Leveraging powerful proprietary models, we synthesize a rich amount of balanced composite images, followed by human-in-the-loop filtering and refinement, resulting in MICo-150K, a comprehensive dataset for MICo with identity consistency. We further build a Decomposition-and-Recomposition (De&Re) subset, where 11K real-world complex images are decomposed into components and recomposed, enabling both real and synthetic compositions. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we construct MICo-Bench with 100 cases per task and 300 challenging De&Re cases, and further introduce a new metric, Weighted-Ref-VIEScore, specifically tailored for MICo evaluation. Finally, we fine-tune multiple models on MICo-150K and evaluate them on MICo-Bench. The results show that MICo-150K effectively equips models without MICo capability and further enhances those with existing skills. Notably, our baseline model, Qwen-MICo, fine-tuned from Qwen-Image-Edit, matches Qwen-Image-2509 in 3-image composition while supporting arbitrary multi-image inputs beyond the latter's limitation. Our dataset, benchmark, and baseline collectively offer valuable resources for further research on Multi-Image Composition."

    "abstract": "Recently, offline reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular RL paradigm. In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged. To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository."

    "abstract": "Dark pions are promising dark matter candidates, yet most analyses rely on leading-order (LO) chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). Motivated by the fact that, even for QCD pi-pi scattering, LO ChPT near threshold underestimates the isoscalar s-wave amplitude by an O(1) factor relative to high-precision dispersive results, we reassess the phenomenology of dark-pion dark matter in SIMP and WIMP scenarios using the chiral unitary method, a nonperturbative resummation that implements the correct analytic structure with minimal input, and quantify how unitarization modifies the standard LO ChPT picture. We fix the subtraction constant to its natural estimate, interpreted as an effective cutoff at the chiral scale, so that the unitarized amplitudes depend only on the dark-pion mass and decay constant. We show that, depending on the coupling, the unitarized amplitudes develop resonance poles absent at LO, leading to sizable departures in 2-to-2 self-scattering, relevant for SIMP scenarios, and in annihilation including initial-state interaction effects, relevant for WIMP scenarios. These modifications, in turn, affect the viable parameter space. Although the subtraction constant is, from a model-building perspective, merely a parameter, a substantial deviation from its natural value would point to additional elementary resonances with the same quantum numbers."

Considering aerial imagery (e.g., modern aerial photos collected through drones, historical photos from aerial archives, high-resolution satellite imagery, etc.) presents unique challenges because spatial resolution varies widely across datasets, the use of color is not consistent, targets often shrink to only a few pixels, and scenes contain very high object densities and objects with partial occlusions. This work presents Aerial-D, a new large-scale referring expression segmentation dataset for aerial imagery, comprising 37,288 images with 1,522,523 referring expressions that cover 259,709 annotated targets, spanning across individual object instances, groups of instances, and semantic regions covering 21 distinct classes that range from vehicles and infrastructure to land coverage types. The dataset was constructed through a fully automatic pipeline that combines systematic rule-based expression generation with a Large Language Model (LLM) enhancement procedure that enriched both the linguistic variety and the focus on visual details within the referring expressions. Filters were additionally used to simulate historic imaging conditions for each scene. We adopted the RSRefSeg architecture, and trained models on Aerial-D together with prior aerial datasets, yielding unified instance and semantic segmentation from text for both modern and historical images. Results show that the combined training achieves competitive performance on contemporary benchmarks, while maintaining strong accuracy under monochrome, sepia, and grainy degradations that appear in archival aerial photography.

An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing."

Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation."

Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code."

This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes.

We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology.

The Hamiltonian combines long-range hopping with virtual corrections encoded by harmonic numbers. An exact walk expansion renders Reggeisation manifest at finite system size. In the bulk continuum limit, evolution reduces to a connection on $\\mathbb{P}^1\\setminus\\{0,1,\\infty\\}$: $Ω(x) = -2\\,dx/x - 4\\,dx/(1-x)$, with solutions in $\\{0,1\\}$-alphabet harmonic polylogarithms. Projecting to the collinear sector via Brown's single-valued map organizes the twist-two anomalous dimension's small-$ω$ expansion, generating polynomials in odd zeta values, matching the transcendentality structure of planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and multi-Regge kinematics. The lattice thus isolates the algebraic core of BFKL evolution."

For risks supported on \\([0,\\infty)\\), we show that VaR sub-additivity is impossible except in the degenerate case of exact additivity, which holds only under co-monotonicity. To characterize when VaR is instead fully super-additive, we introduce two structural conditions: negative simplex dependence (NSD) for the joint distribution and simplex dominance (SD) for a margin-dependent functional. Together, these conditions provide a unified and easily verifiable framework that accommodates non-identical margins, heavy-tailed laws, and a wide spectrum of negative dependence structures. All results extend to random variables with arbitrary finite lower or upper endpoints, yielding sharp constraints on when strict sub- or super-additivity can occur."

    "abstract": "Regular black holes offer a compelling framework to explore the consequences of resolving the central singularity of standard black holes. Using the Simpson-Visser \"black-bounce\" geometry as an elegant, analytically tractable framework, we explore the intricate thermodynamic behavior in such models. We demonstrate that this regular spacetime exhibits a critical instability, marked by a phase transition where the heat capacity is discontinuous. This transition signals a fundamental change in the black hole's evaporation state, which depends on the regularization parameter. Pushing beyond the semiclassical limit, we then derive the leading-order quantum corrections to the entropy via the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism. Our analysis provides a refined statistical basis for the entropy of non-singular spacetimes and offers a quantitative analysis of the nature of the black hole end-state. These results reveal that singularity resolution is not merely a geometric modification but a profound thermodynamic event, with direct implications for the stability and ultimate fate of evaporating black holes."

    "abstract": "Optical thermalization has been recently studied theoretically and experimentally in the 2D spatial evolution of (quasi-)monochromatic light waves propagating in multimode fibers. In this work, we investigate the spatio-temporal equilibrium properties of incoherent multimode optical waves through the analysis of the (2+1)D Bose-Einstein thermal distribution and the corresponding classical Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. In the anomalous dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by positive temperatures. In this regime, we show that as the number of modes of the waveguide increases, the fundamental spatial mode becomes macroscopically populated, while its temporal spectrum undergoes significant narrowing, ultimately leading to complete (2+1)D spatio-temporal condensation in the thermodynamic limit. In the normal dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by negative temperature states that exhibit a hybrid character: the spatial equilibrium displays an inverted modal population, whereas the temporal spectrum remains peaked around the fundamental (carrier) optical frequency. In this regime, we predict that spatio-temporal light waves exhibit a phase transition to Bose-Einstein condensation at negative temperatures, which occurs by increasing the temperature above a negative critical value. Our work opens new avenues for future research, including the possibility for a dual spatio-temporal beam cleaning through full spatio-temporal light condensation, and lay the groundwork for the development of spatio-temporal optical thermodynamics."

Many online conformal prediction methods have been developed to address data distribution shifts in fully adversarial environments, resulting in overly conservative prediction sets. We propose Conformal Optimistic Prediction (COP), an online conformal prediction algorithm incorporating underlying data pattern into the update rule. Through estimated cumulative distribution function of non-conformity scores, COP produces tighter prediction sets when predictable pattern exists, while retaining valid coverage guarantees even when estimates are inaccurate. We establish a joint bound on coverage and regret, which further confirms the validity of our approach. We also prove that COP achieves distribution-free, finite-sample coverage under arbitrary learning rates and can converge when scores are $i.i.d.$. The experimental results also show that COP can achieve valid coverage and construct shorter prediction intervals than other baselines."

We have studied the completeness of the spectrum in terms of the Bethe roots for small lattice sizes and have computed the eigenstate momenta. We found that the spins of the low-lying excitations can have fractional values in accordance with predictions of the underlying conformal field theory.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to match individuals across visible and infrared cameras without relying on any annotation. Given the significant gap across visible and infrared modality, estimating reliable cross-modality association becomes a major challenge in USVI-ReID. Existing methods usually adopt optimal transport to associate the intra-modality clusters, which is prone to propagating the local cluster errors, and also overlooks global instance-level relations. By mining and attending to the visible-infrared modality bias, this paper focuses on addressing cross-modality learning from two aspects: bias-mitigated global association and modality-invariant representation learning. Motivated by the camera-aware distance rectification in single-modality re-ID, we propose modality-aware Jaccard distance to mitigate the distance bias caused by modality discrepancy, so that more reliable cross-modality associations can be estimated through global clustering. To further improve cross-modality representation learning, a `split-and-contrast' strategy is designed to obtain modality-specific global prototypes. By explicitly aligning these prototypes under global association guidance, modality-invariant yet ID-discriminative representation learning can be achieved. While conceptually simple, our method obtains state-of-the-art performance on benchmark VI-ReID datasets and outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, validating its effectiveness."

UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs. By emphasizing transparency and clinician feedback, UltrasODM improves reconstruction reliability and supports safer, more trustworthy clinical workflows.

    "abstract": "Unified understanding and generation is a highly appealing research direction in multimodal learning. There exist two approaches: one trains a transformer via an auto-regressive paradigm, and the other adopts a two-stage scheme connecting pre-trained understanding and generative models for alignment fine-tuning. The former demands massive data and computing resources unaffordable for ordinary researchers. Though the latter requires a lower training cost, existing works often suffer from limited task coverage or poor generation quality. Both approaches lack the ability to parse input meta-information (such as task type, image resolution, video duration, etc.) and require manual parameter configuration that is tedious and non-intelligent. In this paper, we propose Unison which adopts the two-stage scheme while preserving the capabilities of the pre-trained models well. With an extremely low training cost, we cover a variety of multimodal understanding tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as diverse generation tasks, such as text-to-visual content generation, editing, controllable generation, and IP-based reference generation. We also equip our model with the ability to automatically parse user intentions, determine the target task type, and accurately extract the meta-information required for the corresponding task. This enables full automation of various multimodal tasks without human intervention. Experiments demonstrate that, under a low-cost setting of only 500k training samples and 50 GPU hours, our model can accurately and automatically identify tasks and extract relevant parameters, and achieve superior performance across a variety of understanding and generation tasks."

Weighing and integrating these different information sources is a challenging task and a good candidate for support by intelligence-driven tools - however this is yet to be realized in the clinic. Here, we argue that several important barriers to adoption can be addressed using Bayesian network modelling. To demonstrate this, we evaluate a model for depression and anxiety symptom prediction from voice and speech features in large-scale datasets (30,135 unique speakers). Alongside performance for conditions and symptoms (for depression, anxiety ROC-AUC=0.842,0.831 ECE=0.018,0.015; core individual symptom ROC-AUC>0.74), we assess demographic fairness and investigate integration across and redundancy between different input modality types. Clinical usefulness metrics and acceptability to mental health service users are explored. When provided with sufficiently rich and large-scale multimodal data streams and specified to represent common mental conditions at the symptom rather than disorder level, such models are a principled approach for building robust assessment support tools: providing clinically-relevant outputs in a transparent and explainable format that is directly amenable to expert clinical supervision."

The proposed symmetric vaccine efficacy (SVE) is a bounded and interpretable alternative to VE that maintains desirable statistical properties while resolving these asymmetries. SVE is defined as a symmetric transformation of infection risks, with possible values within $[-1, 1]$, providing a common scale for both beneficial and harmful vaccine effects. This paper describes the relationship between SVE and traditional VE, considers inference about SVE, and illustrates the utility of the proposed measure by reanalyzing data from a randomized trial of a candidate HIV vaccine. Open-source tools for computing estimates of SVE and corresponding confidence intervals are available in R through the sve package."

    "abstract": "The continuous Frechet distance between two polygonal curves is classically computed by exploring their free space diagram. Recently, Har-Peled, Raichel, and Robson [SoCG'25] proposed a radically different approach: instead of directly traversing the continuous free space, they approximate the distance by computing paths in a discrete graph derived from the discrete free space, recursively bisecting edges until the discrete value converges to the continuous Frechet distance. They implement this so-called frog-based technique and report substantial practical speedups over the state of the art. We revisit the frog-based approach and address three of its limitations. First, the method does not compute the Frechet distance exactly. Second, the recursive bisection procedure only introduces the monotonicity events required to realise the Frechet distance asymptotically, that is, only in the limit. Third, the applied simplification technique is heuristic. Motivated by theoretical considerations, we develop new techniques that guarantee exactness, polynomial-time convergence, and near-optimal lossless simplifications. We provide an open-source C++ implementation of our variant. Our primary contribution is an extensive empirical evaluation. As expected, exact computation introduces overhead and increases the median running time. Yet, method is often faster in the worst case, the slowest ten percent of instances, or even on average due to its convergence guarantees. More surprisingly, in our experiments, the implementation of Bringmann, Kuennemann, and Nusser [SoCG'19] consistently outperforms all frog-based approaches in practice. This appears to contrast published claims of the efficiency of the frog-based techniques. These results thereby provide nuanced perspective on frogs: highlighting both the theoretical appeal, but also the practical limitations."

Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform."

We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4π$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing.

We empirically validate DA-DP on a variety of tasks, robots, and delays and find its success rate more robust to delay than delay-unaware methods.

In this paper we answer both of these questions by proving that Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers can be encoded in equations over any non-virtually abelian fundamental group of any Seifert fibered 3-manifold whose orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. We use this to show that the equation problem (and hence also the first-order theory) is undecidable in this infinite family of $3$-manifold groups and then apply it to classify the Seifert 3-manifold groups with decidable equation problems and decidable first-order theories, in the case that the orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. In contrast, we show that for this class of Seifert 3-manifold groups the single equation problem is decidable. For every Seifert 3-manifold group $G$ where the orbifold has negative Euler characteristic we show that either $G$ has decidable equation problem or $G$ has a finite index subgroup of index $2$ that has decidable equation problem. These negative Euler characteristic results follow from work of Liang on central extensions of hyperbolic groups. We also discuss why Liang's results do not suffice to deal with all the negative Euler characteristic cases. We show how to construct several other infinite families of $3$-manifold groups with undecidable equation problem (and hence also undecidable first-order theory) including examples that are not Seifert manifold groups and examples that are not virtually nilpotent. In addition, we observe that there are numerous other infinite families for which the first-order theory is undecidable such as fundamental groups of manifolds modeled on 3-dimensional Sol geometry."

    "abstract": "A computational framework is presented for the sampling of the energy surface of magnetic systems via the systematic identification of first-order saddle points that determine connectivity of metastable states and define the mechanisms of transitions between them. The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state."

    "abstract": "Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism."

    "abstract": "A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN)-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed. Unlike conventional pinching antenna systems (PASS), which use a single long waveguide, SWAN divides the waveguide into multiple short segments, each with a dedicated feed point. Thanks to the segmented structure, SWAN enhances sensing performance by significantly simplifying the reception model and reducing the in-waveguide propagation loss. To balance performance and complexity, three segment controlling protocols are proposed for the transceivers, namely i) \\emph{segment selection} to select a single segment for signal transceiving, ii) \\emph{segment aggregation} to aggregate signals from all segments using a single RF chain, and iii) \\emph{segment multiplexing} to jointly process the signals from all segments using individual RF chains. The theoretical sensing performance limit is first analyzed for different protocols, unveiling how the sensing performance gain of SWAN scales with the number of segments. Based on this performance limit, the Pareto fronts of sensing and communication performance are characterized for the simple one-user one-target case, which is then extended to the general multi-user single-target case based on time-division multiple access (TDMA). Numerical results are presented to verify the correctness of the derivations and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which jointly confirm the advantages of SWAN-assisted ISAC."

Our original strict algorithm reached 66-77% success by prioritizing minimal perceptual change ($ΔE \\leq 5.0$), optimizing for enterprise contexts where brand fidelity is paramount. However, this one-size-fits-all approach fails to serve the broader ecosystem of web developers who need accessible solutions even when strict perceptual constraints cannot be satisfied. We introduce recursive optimization (Mode~1) that compounds small adjustments across iterations, achieving 93.68% success on all color pairs and 100% success on reasonable pairs (contrast ratio $ρ> 2.0$), representing a +27.23 percentage point improvement. A relaxed fallback mode (Mode~2) handles pathological edge cases, reaching 98.73% overall success. Evaluation on 10,000 realistic web color pairs demonstrates that context-aware constraint relaxation, combined with absolute hue preservation, enables practical accessibility compliance while maintaining brand color identity. The median perceptual change remains zero across all modes (most pairs already comply), while the 90th percentile reaches $ΔE_{2000} = 15.55$ in Mode~1 -- perceptually acceptable when hue invariance preserves the essential character of the original color. The approach is deployed in CM-Colors v0.5.0 (800+ monthly downloads), providing developers with explicit control over the accessibility-fidelity trade-off appropriate to their context."

The study focuses on analyzing scalability, stability, and power consumption during the execution of computationally intensive workloads, considering different node configurations. The results show that the cluster achieves a performance of up to 6.91 GFLOPS in homogeneous configurations of 6 Raspberry Pi 4 nodes, and that the use of heterogeneous nodes (including Raspberry Pi 3b) can negatively impact stability and efficiency. Additionally, the total electrical consumption of the system was measured during the runs, allowing for the estimation of the performance-to-consumption ratio (GFLOPS/W) as a comparative metric. This study constitutes a concrete contribution to the design, evaluation, and utilization of low-cost ARM clusters in educational and research contexts."

By quantifying the detectability as a function of normalized exposure time, resolving power (R), and amount of spectral points, we can constrain whether spectroscopy or photometry is the more efficient observing procedure to detect H2O at varying abundances by measuring the broad 0.94 microns absorption feature using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We simulate low-resolution spectroscopy (R = 10, 20, 30, presented as photometric bandwidth fraction 10%, 5%, 3% herein) as a proxy for narrow-band photometric observations, and constrain the wavelength range from 0.85 - 1.05 microns, to narrow focus on the 0.9 microns feature. We then constrain the number of spectral points to 2 or 3 points at each bandwidth fraction to investigate the impact of spectral point placement on detectability. Additionally, we take the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for strong H2O detection and calculate the resultant exoplanet yields assuming photometric observation and compare to the yields from higher-resolution spectroscopic observations under different noise instances, characterization wavelength, noise floors, and aperture sizes. We find that H2O is strongly detectable at all bandwidth fractions depending on the spectral point placement, requiring a minimum of 3 spectral points, at a variety of normalized exposure time depending on the abundance of H2O. We also find that the detector noise is the main driver in determining whether photometry or spectroscopy results in higher yields. Photometry is the preferred observational method in high-noise cases, while spectroscopy is preferred in low-noise scenarios."

In the Maximum Quadratic $b$-Matching Assignment Problem, we seek a $b$-matching that maximizes the MaxQAP objective. We refine the standard MaxQAP relaxation and combine randomized rounding over $b$ independent iterations with a polynomial-time algorithm for maximum-weight $b$-matching problem to obtain an $O(\\sqrt{bn})$-approximation. When $b$ is constant and all lists have size $n - O(\\sqrt{n})$, our guarantees asymptotically match the best known approximation factor for MaxQAP, yielding the first approximation algorithms for these two variants."

We demonstrate the generality of the method on flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing for the first time that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex, irregular domains. We show that in the presence of translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry, fluid states exhibit low effective complexity in MPS form, yielding compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics."

Mid-infrared intraband transitions are therefore studied for InAs, InAs/InP, and InAs/ZnSe colloidal quantum dots with an energy gap at 1.4 micron. Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications."

    "abstract": "Online, real-time, and fine-grained 3D segmentation constitutes a fundamental capability for embodied intelligent agents to perceive and comprehend their operational environments. Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing ESAM by 2.8 AP on ScanNet200 and delivering consistent gains on ScanNet, SceneNN, and 3RScan datasets."

We characterize when the invariant subalgebra is semisimple or commutative and examine the equivariant structure of the Peirce components of the semigroup algebra. For CW left regular bands, we interpret these Peirce components in terms of the equivariant topology of intervals in the support semilattice, yielding the Cartan invariants of the invariant subalgebras of left regular bands associated to CAT(0)-cube complexes. We also give a topological formula for the Peirce components for left regular bands with hereditary algebras. Finally, in specializing to left regular bands associated to geometric lattices, we explore generalizations of the Desarménién--Wachs derangement representation and their connections to Markov chains."

The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge."

E-PCN integrates kinematic variables into jet classification by constructing four graph representations per jet, each weighted by a distinct variable: angular separation ($Δ$), transverse momentum ($k_T$), momentum fraction ($z$), and invariant mass squared ($m^2$). We use the concept of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to determine which kinematic variables dominate classification outcomes. Analysis reveals that angular separation and transverse momentum collectively account for approximately 76% of classification decisions (40.72% and 35.67%, respectively), with momentum fraction and invariant mass contributing the remaining 24%.

If the signed support satisfies a combinatorial condition termed nonseparability, we show additionally that this intersection consists of one point, and that tracking one path in homotopy continuation methods suffices to decide upon copositivity. Building on these results, we show that any copositive polynomial with nonseparable signed support can be decomposed into a sum of nonnegative circuit polynomials, generalising thereby previously known supports having this property."

The exact nature of the interactions and the origin of antiferromagnetism are still under debate. Here, we report the observation of signature of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings between different Fe-ions in the anomalous Hall effect measured for devices of mechanically exfoliated Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ nano-flakes of thicknesses ranging from\\,$\\sim$\\,15-20 layers. The temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect data reveal two sharp step-like switchings at low temperature ($T\\lesssim150\\,$K). Our detailed analyses suggest the step-like sharp switchings in anomalous Hall resistance are due to the magnetization reversal behavior of different Fe-ions in individual layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The experimental results can be explained by considering an intra-layer antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+3}$ ions, whereas intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ in the system. Our experimental results and the analyses are supported by the first-principles calculations for energetics and intralayer as well as interlayer exchange coupling constants."

Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities."

These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints."

    "abstract": "We present a novel graph-based learning of EEG representations with gradient alignment (GEEGA) that leverages multi-domain information to learn EEG representations for brain-computer interfaces. Our model leverages graph convolutional networks to fuse embeddings from frequency-based topographical maps and time-frequency spectrograms, capturing inter-domain relationships. GEEGA addresses the challenge of achieving high inter-class separability, which arises from the temporally dynamic and subject-sensitive nature of EEG signals by incorporating the center loss and pairwise difference loss. Additionally, GEEGA incorporates a gradient alignment strategy to resolve conflicts between gradients from different domains and the fused embeddings, ensuring that discrepancies, where gradients point in conflicting directions, are aligned toward a unified optimization direction. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on three publicly available EEG datasets: BCI-2a, CL-Drive and CLARE. Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the impact of various components of our model."

In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{μν})$ containing a caustic $\\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics."

    "abstract": "Future AI systems could conceal their capabilities ('sandbagging') during evaluations, potentially misleading developers and auditors. We stress-tested sandbagging detection techniques using an auditing game. First, a red team fine-tuned five models, some of which conditionally underperformed, as a proxy for sandbagging. Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation. In the longer-term, further research is needed to ensure the efficacy of training-based elicitation, and develop robust methods for sandbagging detection. We open source our model organisms at https://github.com/AI-Safety-Institute/sandbagging_auditing_games and select transcripts and results at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sandbagging-games/evaluation_logs .

    "abstract": "Storytelling in real-world videos often unfolds through multiple shots -- discontinuous yet semantically connected clips that together convey a coherent narrative. However, existing multi-shot video generation (MSV) methods struggle to effectively model long-range cross-shot context, as they rely on limited temporal windows or single keyframe conditioning, leading to degraded performance under complex narratives. In this work, we propose OneStory, enabling global yet compact cross-shot context modeling for consistent and scalable narrative generation. OneStory reformulates MSV as a next-shot generation task, enabling autoregressive shot synthesis while leveraging pretrained image-to-video (I2V) models for strong visual conditioning. We introduce two key modules: a Frame Selection module that constructs a semantically-relevant global memory based on informative frames from prior shots, and an Adaptive Conditioner that performs importance-guided patchification to generate compact context for direct conditioning. We further curate a high-quality multi-shot dataset with referential captions to mirror real-world storytelling patterns, and design effective training strategies under the next-shot paradigm. Finetuned from a pretrained I2V model on our curated 60K dataset, OneStory achieves state-of-the-art narrative coherence across diverse and complex scenes in both text- and image-conditioned settings, enabling controllable and immersive long-form video storytelling."

We argue this is not just a matter of accuracy, but a fundamental gap in how we conceive AI assistance: expert decisions are made through collaborative cognitive processes where mental models, goals, and constraints are continually co-constructed, tested, and revised between human and AI. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda and organizing framework for decision-support agents: systems designed as partners in cognitive work, maintaining evolving models of how particular experts reason, helping articulate and revise goals, co-constructing and stress-testing causal hypotheses, and learning from the outcomes of joint decisions so that both human and agent improve over time. We sketch challenges around training ecologies that make collaborative thinking instrumentally valuable, representations and interaction protocols for co-authored models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can reframe MAS research around agents that participate in collaborative sensemaking and act as AI teammates that think with their human partners."

Through an LLM-assisted pipeline grounded in Value-Sensitive Design (VSD), we mapped the relationships across user-reported sentiments, mental health conditions, perspectives, and values. Our results reveal that the use of LLM chatbots is condition-specific. Users with neurodivergent conditions (e.g., ADHD, ASD) report strong positive sentiments and instrumental or appraisal support, whereas higher-risk disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) show more negative sentiments. We further uncover how user perspectives co-occur with underlying values, such as identity, autonomy, and privacy. Finally, we discuss shifting from \"one-size-fits-all\" chatbot design toward condition-specific, value-sensitive LLM design."

    "abstract": "Generalized splines are a simultaneous generalization of GKM theory -- which studies equivariant cohomology -- and classical splines, which provide piecewise approximations of functions. Generalized splines can also be understood via schemes, with the interpolation constraints -- or so-called GKM-condition -- encoded by gluing along certain closed subschemes. This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness. We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free."

Sliding Window Attention (SWA) achieves linear-time encoding/decoding by constraining the attention pattern, but under an \\textit{Associative Memory} interpretation, its difference-style update renders the training objective effectively \\emph{unbounded}. In contrast, Softmax attention normalizes updates, leading to \\emph{memory shrinkage and gradient vanishing}. We propose GatedFWA: a Memory-\\underline{Gated} (\\underline{F}lash) \\underline{W}indowed \\underline{A}ttention mechanism that preserves SWAs efficiency while stabilizing memory updates and making gradient flow controllable. In essence, GatedFWA accumulate a per-token/head gate into a decay bias added to the attention logits, acting as a learnable contraction in the memory recurrence. We implement a fused one-pass gate preprocessing and a FlashAttention-compatible kernel that injects the gate under a sliding mask, ensuring I/O efficiency and numerical stability. On language modelling benchmarks, GatedFWA delivers competitive throughput with negligible overhead and better use of global context, and it integrates cleanly with token compression/selection methods such as NSA and generalizes to various autoregressive domains."

Cosmic rays injected during the active phase of a microquasar may remain confined within its cocoon and subsequently interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing bright gamma-ray emission through $pp$ collisions. Remnants of former super-Eddington systems can act as dark PeVatrons, releasing particles up to $\\sim$10 PeV that illuminate surrounding clouds producing gamma rays reaching hundreds of TeV. This scenario provides a natural explanation for several unidentified Galactic LHAASO sources."

We used central galaxies with log10(Mgal/Msun)=[9,11] from CIELO simulations. We identified stellar halos, from z=3.5 to z=0, using the AM-E method, focusing on the region between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We presented halo cardiograms, a novel approach to studying the assembly history of stellar halos. Using them, we defined a stability time (tst) as the first time that the median halo metallicity does not change more than \\pm 0.1 dex with respect to its value at z=0. CIELO stellar halos reproduce the present-day observed MZhR. At z=3.5, stellar halos already define an MZhR whose slope is similar to the slope at z=0. For a fixed stellar halo mass, the metallicity increases ~0.21 dex from z=3.5 to z=0, reflecting the progressive chemical enrichment provided by the accretion of satellites with diverse masses and different levels of enrichment. When the first stellar halo main contributor (SHMC1) provides a mass fraction at least 20% higher than the remaining contributors, the stellar halo metallicity is set once SHMC1 is fully disrupted (tmerger). This yields a clear correlation between tst and tmerger, with a scatter of 2.2 Gyr driven by the relative importance of the second and third main contributing satellites. We provide two observational tracers for tst: t90 and a stability time from the age-metallicity relation. Our results suggest that estimating tst could serve as a proxy for dating the moment at which the stellar halo reaches the present-day MZhR, as well as for dating the last major merger that builds them. Combined with an estimation of the merger time of the main contributing satellite, it can provide insights into the relative importance of the second and third contributing satellites. (abridged)"

However, signals in pump-probe microscopy are typically small and often must be measured in the presence of large backgrounds. As a result, achieving measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio is challenging, particularly when using sensors that are easily saturated, such as CMOS cameras. We present a method for enhancing signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding detector saturation. In this approach, temporally separated (sheared) reference and probe pulses transmit through a sample before and after the arrival of a pump pulse. The probe and reference pulses are then temporally recombined with opposing phases and nearly matched amplitudes, resulting in interferometric background subtraction. This recombining operation is performed by a novel common-path interferometer. Unlike previous techniques for temporal shearing, this interferometer demonstrates negligible phase and group delay dispersion with angle of incidence, allowing convenient widefield imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first common-path interferometer with such a property. We demonstrate the technique by measuring transient absorption signals in gold nanorod films with a signal-to-background ratio enhanced by over 100% and a signal-to-noise ratio enhanced by about 70%."

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, \"in-the-wild\" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species"

As autonomy requires reasoning and planning on multiple scales of the environment, each algorithm may require a different map for optimal performance. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors generate an abundance of geometric data to satisfy these diverse requirements, but selecting informative, size-constrained maps is computationally challenging as it requires solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization. In this work we present OptMap: a geometric map distillation algorithm which achieves real-time, application-specific map generation via multiple theoretical and algorithmic innovations. A central feature is the maximization of set functions that exhibit diminishing returns, i.e., submodularity, using polynomial-time algorithms with provably near-optimal solutions. We formulate a novel submodular reward function which quantifies informativeness, reduces input set sizes, and minimizes bias in sequentially collected datasets. Further, we propose a dynamically reordered streaming submodular algorithm which improves empirical solution quality and addresses input order bias via an online approximation of the value of all scans. Testing was conducted on open-source and custom datasets with an emphasis on long-duration mapping sessions, highlighting OptMap's minimal computation requirements. Open-source ROS1 and ROS2 packages are available and can be used alongside any LiDAR SLAM algorithm."

In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings."

As an alternative, dynamical models for simulation and control design can be obtained by black-box identification techniques.

For training and inference, they require initial values of system states, such as phase angles and frequencies. While frequencies can typically be measured, phase angle measurements are usually not available. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel structure based on augmented neural ordinary differential equations, learning latent phase angle representations on historic observations with temporal convolutional networks. Our approach combines state-of-the art deep learning techniques, avoiding the necessity of phase angle information for the power system identification.

In the fields of atmospheric science and environmental monitoring, estimating emission source locations is a central task that further relies on multiple model parameters that dictate velocity profiles and diffusion parameters. Estimating these parameters at the same time as emission sources from scarce data is a difficult task. In this work, we achieve this by leveraging the flexibility and generality of PINNs. We use a weighted adaptive method based on the neural tangent kernels to solve a source inversion problem with parameter estimation on the 2D and 3D advection-diffusion equations with unknown velocity and diffusion coefficients that may vary in space and time. Our proposed weighted adaptive method is presented as an extension of PINNs for forward PDE problems to a highly ill-posed source inversion and parameter estimation problem. The key idea behind our methodology is to attempt the joint recovery of the solution, the sources along with the unknown parameters, thereby using the underlying partial differential equation as a constraint that couples multiple unknown functional parameters, leading to more efficient use of the limited information in the measurements. We present various numerical experiments, using different types of measurements that model practical engineering systems, to show that our proposed method is indeed successful and robust to additional noise in the measurements."

    "abstract": "We give an expansion in $1/N$ and $β$ of the cumulants of power sums of the particles of the $β$-ensemble. This new expansion is obtained using the tridiagonal model of Dumitriu and Edelman. The coefficients of the expansion are expressed in terms of suitably labelled maps introduced by Bouttier, Fusy, and Guitter. Our expansion is of a different nature than the one obtained by LaCroix in is study of the $b$-conjecture of Goulden and Jackson, and involves only orientable maps. We are able to relate bijectively the first two orders of our expansion to the one of LaCroix using a novel many-to-one mapping that relates suitably labelled planar maps with two minima and maps on the projective plane."

But operators do not have tools to help them understand how each model and the interaction between them affect the end-to-end system performance. SANJESH is such a tool. SANJESH supports a diverse set of performance-related queries which we answer through a bi-level optimization. We invent novel mechanisms to solve this optimization more quickly. These techniques allow us to solve an optimization which prior work failed to solve even after $24$ hours. As a proof of concept, we apply SANJESH to an example production system that uses multiple ML models to optimize virtual machine (VM) placement. These models impact how many servers the operators uses to host VMs and the frequency with which it has to live-migrate them because the servers run out of resources. SANJESH finds scenarios where these models cause $~4\\times$ worse performance than what simulation-based approaches detect."

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures."

The abstract balls in their definition owe four basic properties of classical balls in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which are crucial in the study of singular operators on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Among various properties studied in these papers it was proved that $BO$ operators allow pointwise sparse domination, establishing the $A_2$-conjecture for those operators. In the present paper we study boundedness properties of $BO$ operators on $BMO$ spaces. In particular, we prove that general $BO$ operators boundedly map $L^\\infty$ into $BMO$, and under a logarithmic localization condition those map $BMO$ into itself. We obtain these properties as corollaries of new local type bounds, involving oscillations of functions over the balls. We apply the results in the $BMO$ estimations of Calderón-Zygmund operators, martingale transforms, Carleson type operators, as well as in the unconditional basis properties of general wavelet type systems in atomic Hardy spaces $H^1$."

    "abstract": "In future 6G networks, dependable networks will enable telecommunication services such as remote control of robots or vehicles with strict requirements on end-to-end network performance in terms of delay, delay variation, tail distributions, and throughput. With respect to such networks, it is paramount to be able to determine what performance level the network segment can guarantee at a given point in time. One promising approach is to use predictive models trained using machine learning (ML). Predicting performance metrics such as one-way delay (OWD), in a timely manner, provides valuable insights for the network, user equipments (UEs), and applications to address performance trends, deviations, and violations. Over the course of time, a dynamic network environment results in distributional shifts, which causes catastrophic forgetting and drop of ML model performance. In continual learning (CL), the model aims to achieve a balance between stability and plasticity, enabling new information to be learned while preserving previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we target on the challenges of catastrophic forgetting of OWD prediction model. We propose a novel approach which introducing the concept of multi-generator for the state-of-the-art CL generative replay framework, along with tabular variational autoencoders (TVAE) as generators. The domain knowledge of UE capabilities is incorporated into the learning process for determining generator setup and relevance. The proposed approach is evaluated across a diverse set of scenarios with data that is collected in a realistic 5G testbed, demonstrating its outstanding performance in comparison to baselines."

We characterize the latter in terms of tensor-like and hom-like functors. As an application we obtain a characterization of equivalences between such categories in the spirit of Morita theory. Then we introduce restriction and induction functors between categories of type $gr-(R,G,X)$ and show that many functors between such categories can be realized naturally as a restriction or induction functor. This includes the forgetful functor, the functor associating a $G$ graded $R$-module with the $H$-graded module formed by the sum of the homogeneous components of degree in subgroupoid $H$, and the one associating it with the collapsing of homogeneous components in cosets modulo $H$ for $H$ a wide subgrupoid. We characterize when a restriction or induction functor is an equivalence of categories.

First, for a broad class of Schur-convex inequality measures, we characterize extremal allocations and show that sharp bounds are attained by distributions with simple, finite support, reducing the underlying infinite-dimensional problem to finite-dimensional optimization. Second, for indices that admit linear-fractional representations after suitable ordering of the data (including the Gini coefficient, quantile ratios, and the Hoover index), we recast the bound problems as linear or quadratic programs, yielding fast computation of numerically sharp bounds. Third, we establish $\\sqrt{n}$ inference for bound endpoints using a uniform directional delta method and a bootstrap procedure for standard errors. In ELSA wealth data with mixed point and interval observations, we obtain sharp Gini bounds of 0.714--0.792 for liquid savings and 0.686--0.767 for a broad savings measure; historical U.S. income tables deliver time-series bounds for the Gini, quantile ratios, and Hoover index under grouped information."

These approaches, and in particular deep learning-based models such as LSTM and TCN, have shown great results in predicting time series data. With the advancement of leveraging pre-trained foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and more notably Google's recent foundation model for time series data, {\\it TimesFM} (Time Series Foundation Model), it is of interest to investigate whether these foundation models have the capability of outperforming existing modeling approaches in analyzing and predicting time series data. This paper investigates the performance of using LLM models for time series data prediction. We investigate the in-context learning methodology in the training of LLM models that are specific to the underlying application domain. More specifically, the paper explores training LLMs through in-context, zero-shot and few-shot learning and forecasting time series data with OpenAI {\\tt o4-mini} and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, as well as the recent Google's Transformer-based TimesFM, a time series-specific foundation model, along with two deep learning models, namely TCN and LSTM networks. The findings indicate that TimesFM has the best overall performance with the lowest RMSE value (0.3023) and the competitive inference time (266 seconds). Furthermore, OpenAI's o4-mini also exhibits a good performance based on Zero Shot learning.

    "abstract": "Large foundation models have emerged in the last years and are pushing performance boundaries for a variety of tasks. Training or even finetuning such models demands vast datasets and computational resources, which are often scarce and costly. Adaptation methods provide a computationally efficient solution to address these limitations by allowing such models to be finetuned on small amounts of data and computing power. This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner. This modification naturally allows handling inherent ambiguities in the input and allows for different sampling configurations during training and testing. A comprehensive evaluation was performed on the VTAB-1k benchmark and seven adapters, with PVeRA outperforming VeRA and other adapters. Our code for training models with PVeRA and benchmarking all adapters is available https://github.com/leofillioux/pvera."

The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against the FDA OCMQ v3.0 (104 queries), restricted to valid MedDRA PTs. Precision, recall and F1 were computed across similarity-thresholds. High recall (>95%) is achieved at moderate thresholds. Higher thresholds improve precision (up to 86%). The optimal threshold (~0.70 - 0.75) yielded recall ~50% and precision ~33%. Narrow-term PT subsets performed similarly but required slightly higher similarity thresholds. The SafeTerm AI-driven system provides a viable supplementary method for automated MedDRA query generation. A similarity threshold of ~0.60 is recommended initially, with increased thresholds for refined term selection."

At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models."

Although most observed compact binary coalescences are expected to circularize before entering the sensitivity band of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, dynamical interactions in dense star clusters can lead to a fraction of these binaries with non-negligible eccentricity at the time of detection. To quantify the observability of eccentricity, we simulate a population of merging compact binaries and identify those which have sufficient power in sub-dominant eccentric harmonics to be clearly distinguishable from quasi-circular systems. We consider a binary black hole (BBH) population derived from globular cluster simulations with residual eccentricity distribution obtained from Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) catalogs as well as a fiducial log-uniform model. Assuming the LIGO-Virgo network of GW detectors with their sensitivities achieved during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Observing Run (O4), we find that the BBH population with measurable eccentricity will have a significantly higher median eccentricity $e_{\\mathrm{10Hz}}\\sim 0.3$ (with $90\\%$ range: $0.1 - 0.5$) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\\sim 20$ ($90\\%$ range: $13 - 57$) compared to the observable population of BBHs.

Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost.

High-functioning human organizations have faced similar balancing issues, which led to evidence-based theories that seek to understand their functioning strategies. We examine the parallels between LLM agents and the compatible frameworks in organization science, focusing on what the design, scaling, and management of organizations can inform agentic systems towards improving reliability. We offer three preliminary accounts of organizational principles for AI agent engineering to attain reliability and effectiveness, through balancing agency and capabilities in agent design, resource constraints and performance benefits in agent scaling, and internal and external mechanisms in agent management.

Our analysis identifies certain limitations in previous approaches and introduces a clearer, more systematic framework for model builders. We expand our classification by investigating more generalised symmetry structures -- the recently identified GOOFy transformations, which act non-trivially on the Higgs doublets and their conjugates.

    "abstract": "In the context of municipal heat planning, it is imperative to consider the numerous buildings, numbering in the hundreds or thousands, that are involved. This poses particular challenges for model-based energy system optimization, as the number of variables increases with the number of buildings under consideration. In the worst case, the computational complexity of the models experiences an exponential increase with the number of variables. Furthermore, within the context of heat transition, it is often necessary to map extended periods of time (i.e., the service life of systems) with high resolution (particularly in the case of load peaks that occur at the onset of the day). In response to these challenges, the aggregation of input data is a common practice. In general, building blocks or other geographical and urban formations, such as neighbourhoods, are combined. This article explores the potential of incorporating energy performance indicators into the grouping of buildings. The case study utilizes authentic data from the Neu-Schwachhausen district, grouped based on geographical location, building geometry, and energy performance indicators. The selection of energy indicators includes the annual heat consumption as well as the potential for solar energy generation. To this end, a methodology is hereby presented that considers not only the anticipated annual energy quantity, but also its progression over time. We present a full workflow from geodata to a set of techno-socio-economically Pareto-optimal heat supply options. Our findings suggest that it is beneficial to find a balance between geographical position and energy properties when grouping buildings for the use in energy system models."

    "abstract": "Integrability structures are known to play a key role in one-dimensional scattering. In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi & Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the \"KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative\" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a \"semi-direct action\" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the \"wave-mean flow\" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research."

    "abstract": "Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) is a highly intriguing candidate for heterostructure optoelectronic applications, such as Deep Ultraviolet photodetectors, UV sensing and communication systems and solar cells. This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication."

As use-case diversity grows exponentially and user adoption drives traffic to unprecedented and highly dynamic levels, novel service orchestration mechanisms are indispensable. In this paper, we adopt an architectural viewpoint, examining Service Registration, Indexing, Discovery, and Selection (SRIDS) as fundamental elements of 6G service provision. We first establish the theoretical foundations of SRIDS in 6G by defining its core concepts, detailing its end-to-end workflow, reviewing current standardization efforts, and projecting its future design objectives, including reliability, scalability, automaticity and adaptability, determinism, efficiency, sustainability, semantic-awareness, security, privacy, and trust. We then perform a comprehensive literature review and gap analysis encompassing both existing surveys and recent research efforts, identifying conceptual and methodological gaps that hinder unified SRIDS in 6G. Next, we introduce a taxonomy that classifies SRIDS mechanisms into centralized, distributed, decentralized, and hybrid architectures, and systematically examine the relevant studies within each category. Each work is evaluated against the extracted design objectives. Building on these findings, we propose a hybrid architectural framework, combining centralized data management to ensure consistency and agility with distributed coordination to enhance scalability in emerging 6G use cases. The framework incorporates innovative technologies, such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). We conclude by highlighting open challenges and suggesting directions for future research."

We find that radial alignment is substantially stronger than orbital alignment, with both signals being consistently stronger for subhalos than for satellites. Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the alignment reported by Pace et al. (2022) for MW satellites is due to projection effects, as the major axes of satellites lie within their orbital planes, approximately coplanar with the observer."

We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\\Ceff = (\\Itotal/\\Istep), \\Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \\"

However, the situation for unbounded generators is only understood for index one if modal decompositions are available. Here, we prove long- and short-time estimates for unbounded generators with higher index admitting a modal decomposition. Additionally, an explicit Lyapunov functional is constructed.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates chains of rotating boson stars (BSs) within Einstein gravity coupled to a complex scalar field. The model incorporates quartic or sextic self-interactions in the scalar Lagrangian, which support the existence of stationary, solitonic, gravitationally bound solutions. We numerically construct these multi-component systems and investigate how the self-interactions alter their global properties -- specifically the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass $M$, the angular momentum $J$ and the morphology of their ergospheres. A central result is the distinct dependence of the $(ω, M)$ and $(ω, J)$ relations on the parity of the chains. Specifically, systems with an even number of constituents display spiraling curves, while those with an odd number exhibit loop structures. Moreover, we observe that two initially distinct ergospheres merge into a single one as the frequency $ω$ increases. Our analysis also indicates that the quartic interaction imposes more restrictive existence bounds, particularly for odd-numbered chains, thereby restricting stable configurations to the weak-coupling regime. In contrast, the sextic interaction has a weaker effect and enables stable solutions at substantially stronger couplings."

Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \\mathrm{μm}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$γ$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation.

VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \\ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \\mathrm{μm}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region."

These high aspect ratio devices are usually fabricated by complex, costly, multi-step processes that limit their size and volume scaling. These steps commonly involve UV or X-ray lithography, semiconductor selective etching and high-Z metal plating, usually Au, which require expensive tools and materials. Here we present a proof-of-concept fabrication via soft lithography and Hg infusion of microfluidic X-ray absorption gratings and their performance in biomedical imaging. Such fabrication technique requires fewer, less expensive, and more scalable processes using alternative and more sustainable materials, while showing comparable visibility with their conventional Au-based, solid equivalent. Our results constitute a promising shift in X-ray optics fabrication that could significantly lower barriers to commercialization and accelerate the practical deployment of X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging."

    "abstract": "In ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting systems, the input power to the rectifier is low. To improve rectification efficiency, Schottky diodes, which are sensitive to low power, are commonly selected as rectifying devices to convert microwave power into dc power. However, low-power rectifying diodes typically have low reverse breakdown voltages, making them susceptible to reverse breakdown under high power conditions. This letter proposes a low-power rectifier with reconfigurable function. The rectifying diode is connected in parallel with the p-i-n diode. At low input power, the output dc voltage is low, and the p-i-n diode remains off, having no impact on the rectifier operation. As the input power increases, the p-i-n diode turns on, causing change in circuit structure and impedance mismatch. This leads to increased reflected power, thereby preventing the rectifying diode from receiving excessive power. In addition, the turn-on voltage of the p-i-n diode is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage of the rectifying diode, protecting it from reverse breakdown."

    "abstract": "The pair-density-wave (PDW) is an exotic pairing state hosting a spatially modulated pairing order parameter, which has attracted great interest. Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D. Our work appeals for experimental verifications."

    "abstract": "Analysing learning behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments is challenging, in particular with respect to \\textit{individual} decision-making. Practitioners frequently tend to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few. Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \\textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes."

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA. Experimental results demonstrate that our ViVLA is able to acquire novel manipulation skills from only a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach achieves over 30% improvement on unseen LIBERO tasks and maintains above 35% gains with cross-embodiment videos. Real-world experiments demonstrate effective learning from human videos, yielding more than 38% improvement on unseen tasks."

    "abstract": "Cross-modal learning has become a fundamental paradigm for integrating heterogeneous information sources such as images, text, and structured attributes. However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while naïve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines."

The relationship among five related Hawkes processes is studied. The expectations of the three classes of renewal Hawkes processes are derived by establishing a set of integral equations. A general common renewal equation for these expectations is derived and further discussions are provided. The special case of constant exogenous factor is discussed as well for the three proposed Hawkes processes. Finally, we apply our proposed models to study the optimization problems that arise in a periodic replacement policy for systems with cascading failures and provide numerical illustrations.

Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations."

Our approach is gauge theoretical and builds on the theory of Kähler fibrations and the moment map interpretation of constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics. Our first main result establishes that, over the moduli space of cscK metrics, the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations carries a natural complex structure together with a family of pseudo-Kähler metrics forming a Kähler fibration with a Kähler Ehresmann connection. We then investigate a second universal moduli space, constructed from the space of flat $G$-connections over $\\mathcal{T}$, which admits a nontrivial $J$-dependent Kähler fibration structure discovered by Hitchin. Using symplectic reduction, we build universal moduli spaces of solutions to the harmonicity equations depending on a coupling constant $α$, obtaining natural complex and pseudo-Kähler structures and an explicit Kähler potential. The main novelty here is that this moduli space is defined by a system coupling the scalar curvature with a cubic term in the Higgs field. Finally, we propose a conjectural relationship between the two resulting families of moduli spaces in the weak-coupling limit $α\\to 0$, inspired by the twistor geometry of Hitchin's hyperkähler moduli space."

    "abstract": "Most existing latent-space models for dynamical systems require fixing the latent dimension in advance, they rely on complex loss balancing to approximate linear dynamics, and they don't regularize the latent variables. We introduce RRAEDy, a model that removes these limitations by discovering the appropriate latent dimension, while enforcing both regularized and linearized dynamics in the latent space. Built upon Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs), RRAEDy automatically rank and prune latent variables through their singular values while learning a latent Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) operator that governs their temporal progression. This structure-free yet linearly constrained formulation enables the model to learn stable and low-dimensional dynamics without auxiliary losses or manual tuning. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the stability of the learned operator and showcase the generality of our model by proposing an extension that handles parametric ODEs. Experiments on canonical benchmarks, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Burgers' equation, 2D Navier-Stokes, and Rotating Gaussians, show that RRAEDy achieves accurate and robust predictions.

However, we observed that annotations dissimilar to the human annotation could achieve a higher model likelihood than the human annotation. We address this issue by applying Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD models. Specifically, we employ sentence- and span-level similarity metrics as utility functions to select candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Extensive experimental results show that our MBR decoding outperforms the MAP baseline at the system, sentence, and span-levels. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational cost of MBR decoding, we demonstrate that applying MBR distillation enables a standard greedy model to match MBR decoding performance, effectively eliminating the inference-time latency bottleneck."

Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

However, in the current race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), sovereign actors are exhibiting behaviors contrary to theoretical predictions: the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite acknowledging the potential for catastrophic failure from AGI misalignment. We resolve this puzzle by formalizing the AGI race as a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk. In our model, the cost of failure is no longer bounded only by the sunk cost of investment (I), but rather a systemic ruin parameter (D) that is correlated with development velocity and shared globally. As the disutility of catastrophe is embedded in both players' payoffs, the risk term mathematically cancels out of the equilibrium indifference condition. This creates a \"suicide region\" in the investment space where competitive pressures force rational agents to deploy AGI systems early, despite a negative risk-adjusted net present value. Furthermore, we show that \"warning shots\" (sub-existential disasters) will fail to deter AGI acceleration, as the winner-takes-all nature of the race remains intact. The race can only be halted if the cost of ruin is internalized, making safety research a prerequisite for economic viability. We derive the critical private liability threshold required to restore the option value of waiting and propose mechanism design interventions that can better ensure safe AGI research and socially responsible deployment."

Traditional testing methods, such as virtual simulation, closed-course, and public road testing, face several challenges, including unrealistic vehicle states, limited testing capabilities, and high costs. These issues have prompted increasing interest in virtual-physical fusion testing. However, despite its potential, virtual-physical fusion testing still faces challenges, such as limited element types, narrow testing scope, and fixed evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose the Virtual-Physical Testing Platform for Autonomous Vehicles (VP-AutoTest), which integrates over ten types of virtual and physical elements, including vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside infrastructure, to replicate the diversity of real-world traffic participants. The platform also supports both single-vehicle interaction and multi-vehicle cooperation testing, employing adversarial testing and parallel deduction to accelerate fault detection and explore algorithmic limits, while OBU and Redis communication enable seamless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation across all levels of cooperative automation. Furthermore, VP-AutoTest incorporates a multidimensional evaluation framework and AI-driven expert systems to conduct comprehensive performance assessment and defect diagnosis. Finally, by comparing virtual-physical fusion test results with real-world experiments, the platform performs credibility self-evaluation to ensure both the fidelity and efficiency of autonomous driving testing.

The model was trained and evaluated using multiple properties as conditions, including fundamental properties, such as density and space group, as well as more practical targets, such as band gap and magnetic density.

Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains."

In an extended notion, called relational patterns and relational pattern languages, variables may be related by arbitrary other relations. We extend the ongoing investigation of the main decision problems for patterns (namely, the membership problem, the inclusion problem, and the equivalence problem) to relational pattern languages under a wide range of individual relations. It is shown show that - even for many much simpler or less restrictive relations - the complexity and (un)decidability characteristics of these problems do not change compared to the classical case where variables are related only by equality."

A significant challenge is translating application-level requests into the concrete instructions executable at lower layers. In this work, we introduce a RuleSet-based framework that explicitly incorporates the application layer into the layered architecture of the Quantum Internet. Our framework builds on a RuleSet-based protocol, clarifying communication procedures, organizing application request information, and introducing new Rules for application execution by embedding application specifications into RuleSets. To evaluate feasibility, we constructed state machines from the generated RuleSets. This approach enables a transparent integration from the application layer down to the physical layer, thereby lowering barriers to deploying new applications on the Quantum Internet."

Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences."

In such settings, limited perception, ambiguous terrain cues, and insufficient adaptation of gait timing can cause even a single misplaced or mistimed step to result in rapid loss of balance. We introduce a perceptive locomotion framework that merges terrain sensing, gait regulation, and whole-body control into a single reinforcement learning policy. A downward-facing depth camera mounted under the base observes the support region around the feet, and a compact U-Net reconstructs a dense egocentric height map from each frame in real time, operating at the same frequency as the control loop. The perceptual height map, together with proprioceptive observations, is processed by a unified policy that produces joint commands and a global stepping-phase signal, allowing gait timing and whole-body posture to be adapted jointly to the commanded motion and local terrain geometry. We further adopt a single-stage successive teacher-student training scheme for efficient policy learning and knowledge transfer. Experiments conducted on a 31-DoF, 1.65 m humanoid robot demonstrate robust locomotion in both simulation and real-world settings, including forward and backward stair ascent and descent, as well as crossing a 46 cm gap.

Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena."

    "abstract": "Massive stars and their winds have a large influence in their environment, e.g, determining the accretion rate on to the Galactic Centre (GC) super-massive black hole Sgr A*. The winds of those stars collide and are accreted, at a rate that depends on their chemical composition. Here we aim to revisit the evolutionary status of the evolved massive stars at the GC, by means of new tracks based on updated mass-loss rate recipes for the earlier stages of massive stars. We use the Geneva-evolution-code for initial stellar masses ranging from 20 to 60 $M_\\odot$, for metallicity $Z=0.020$. We adopt a new mass-loss rate recipe for the line-driven winds of O-type stars and B-supergiants, plus a new recipe for the dust-driven winds of red supergiants (RSG). Additionally, we set up initial rotation $Ω/Ω_\\text{crit}=0.4$, and we adopt the Ledoux criterion for the treatment of convection in inner layers. We found that evolution models adopting new mass-loss rate prescriptions predict that stars will lose less of their outer layers during their initial phases, while a big reduction of mass happens at the RSG phase. As a consequence, the resulting Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are less radially homogeneous in their inner structure from the core to the surface. Also, these new evolution models predict the absence of hydrogen-free WN stars. These evolutionary predictions agree better with the observed chemical abundances of the WR stars at the GC. We provide a table with the chemical H, He, and CNO abundances calculated for the different subtypes of WR stars. We propose a different re-arrangement of the WR subtypes to be used for the modelling of the collision of their winds. We discuss the potential implications of these changes for the colliding winds generated from the massive stars at the GC, which are accreting onto the supermassive black hole Sgr A*."

    "abstract": "Reliable regional climate information is essential for assessing the impacts of climate change and for planning in sectors such as renewable energy; yet, producing high-resolution projections through coordinated initiatives like CORDEX that run multiple physical regional climate models is both computationally demanding and difficult to organize. Machine learning emulators that learn the mapping between global and regional climate fields offer a promising way to address these limitations. Here we introduce the application of such an emulator: trained on CMIP5 and CORDEX simulations, it reproduces regional climate model data with sufficient accuracy. When applied to CMIP6 simulations not seen during training, it also produces realistic results, indicating stable performance. Using CORDEX data, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations, as well as regional data generated by two machine learning models, we analyze the co-occurrence of low wind speed and low solar radiation and find indications that the number of such energy drought days is likely to decrease in the future. Our results highlight that downscaling with machine learning emulators provides an efficient complement to efforts such as CORDEX, supplying the higher-resolution information required for impact assessments."

    "abstract": "Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ) liberates the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) bottleneck, which garnered increasing research attention. However, conventional methods either searched from costly differentiable optimization, which is neither efficient nor flexible, or learned a quantized DNN from the proxy (i.e., HAWQ) manually designed by human experts, which is labor-intensive and requires huge expert knowledge. Can we design a proxy without involving any human experts and training? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-driven Training-free Automatic Proxy (dubbed TAP) discovery framework, which reforms the design paradigm of MPQ by utilizing LLMs to find superior TAP tailored for MPQ, automatically. In addition, to bridge the gap between black-box LLMs and the tough MPQ task, we ingeniously propose simple Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by optimizing prompts, which can construct a positive feedback loop between the LLM and the MPQ task, enabling LLMs to generate better TAP in the next evolution. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TAP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we truly believe that our TAP will significantly contribute to the MPQ community by providing a new perspective on LLM-driven design algorithms."

    "abstract": "Effective traffic control is essential for mitigating congestion in transportation networks. Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures."

Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods for trap stiffness calibration are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping has been largely overlooked and is often assumed to behave analogously to translational dynamics. However, rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work covers passive analysis techniques for calibrating the angular trap stiffness and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, while offering unprecedented improvements for nanoparticle analysis. We also explore the combined effects of shape-induced and material birefringence in spheroidal vaterite probes, and present a framework for assessing hydrodynamic and inertial contributions. These results provide a foundation for characterising rotational optical tweezers independent from translational models."

Our approach is based on selecting a minimal set of carefully chosen qubit configurations that can be reliably prepared and measured in order to provide an interpretable methodology of parameter identification while potentially minimizing experimental overhead. The protocol relies on saturating control pulses to generate these configurations. In an idealized regime of infinite-amplitude pulses, we demonstrate that the parameters can be reconstructed analytically from the measured observables. We then consider large but finite pulses as a perturbation of this ideal regime and provide bounds on the estimation error introduced by the practical implementation. This framework allows us to separate the sources of uncertainty in the estimation procedure, distinguishing between statistical fluctuations arising from repeated measurements and modeling errors due to deviations from the ideal pulse regime."

Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a tri-band shared-aperture antenna array with three wide bands, covering the 5G mid-band and the 6G centimetric band, which is a promising candidate for future 6G base station antennas. The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands."

In this paper, we make this analogy explicit across four problem classes with a unified solution characterization. This novel framework, in turn, allows for a systematic transformation of algorithms from one domain to the other. In particular, we identify equivalent optimization and control algorithms that have already been pointed out in the existing literature, but mostly in a scattered way. We also discuss the issues arising in providing theoretical convergence guarantees for these new control algorithms and provide simple yet effective techniques to solve them. The provided framework and techniques then lay out a concrete methodology for developing new convergent control algorithms."

Traditional model unlearning approaches require computationally expensive fine-tuning or direct weight editing, making them impractical for real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce LoRA-based Unlearning with Negative Examples (LUNE), a lightweight framework that performs negative-only unlearning by updating only low-rank adapters while freezing the backbone, thereby localizing edits and avoiding disruptive global changes. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), LUNE targets intermediate representations to suppress (or replace) requested knowledge with an order-of-magnitude lower compute and memory than full fine-tuning or direct weight editing. Extensive experiments on multiple factual unlearning tasks show that LUNE: (I) achieves effectiveness comparable to full fine-tuning and memory-editing methods, and (II) reduces computational cost by about an order of magnitude."

To scale from a single annotated episode to the full dataset, ESPADA propagates segment labels via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) on dynamics-only features. Across both simulation and real-world experiments with ACT and DP baselines, ESPADA achieves approximately a 2x speed-up while maintaining success rates, narrowing the gap between human demonstrations and efficient robot control."

Poincare surfaces of section reveal transitions between regular and chaotic motions that depend sensitively on the vorton tension $Gμ$ and initial conditions. We further compute the Lense-Thirring and general spin-precession frequencies for gyroscopes along Killing trajectories. The resulting precession profiles exhibit several distinct features not present in Kerr black holes but reminiscent of Kerr naked singularities, such as: divergences near the ring core, and multi-minima structures.

We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms.

Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy."

    "abstract": "Decision making often occurs in the presence of incomplete information, leading to the under- or overestimation of risk. Leveraging the observable information to learn the complete information is called nowcasting. In practice, incomplete information is often a consequence of reporting or observation delays. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximisation (EM) framework for nowcasting that uses machine learning techniques to model both the occurrence as well as the reporting process of events. We allow for the inclusion of covariate information specific to the occurrence and reporting periods as well as characteristics related to the entity for which events occurred. We demonstrate how the maximisation step and the information flow between EM iterations can be tailored to leverage the predictive power of neural networks and (extreme) gradient boosting machines (XGBoost). With simulation experiments, we show that we can effectively model both the occurrence and reporting of events when dealing with high-dimensional covariate information. In the presence of non-linear effects, we show that our methodology outperforms existing EM-based nowcasting frameworks that use generalised linear models in the maximisation step. Finally, we apply the framework to the reporting of Argentinian Covid-19 cases, where the XGBoost-based approach again is most performant."

Building upon the generalization of the Bedford-Taylor pluripotential theory to complex Hessian equations by Kołodziej-Nguyen, we solve these equations in the $(ω, m)$-positive cone, $(ω, m)$-big classes and in nef classes, where $ω$ is a reference Hermitian metric. These results are also new in the Kähler case. Moreover, we adapt our techniques to solve complex Monge-Ampère equations in nef classes with mild singularities. The solutions we obtain, in the compact Kähler case, coincide with those for the complex Monge-Ampère equations in the sense of the non-pluripolar product introduced by Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi. One of the key ingredients in the proof is the adaption, to the Hermitian setting, of a new a priori $L^\\infty$-estimate established by Guo-Phong-Tong and Guo-Phong-Tong-Wang."

    "abstract": "Oysters in Virginia Chesapeake Bay oyster reefs are \"age-truncated\", possibly due to a combination of historical overfishing, disease epizootics, environmental degradation, and climate change. Research has suggested that oysters exhibit resilience to environmental stressors; however, that evidence is based on the current limited understanding of oyster lifespan. Until this paper, the Virginia Oyster Stock Assessment and Replenishment Archive (VOSARA), a spatially and temporally expansive dataset (222 reefs across 2003-2023) of shell lengths (SL, mm), had yet to be examined comprehensively in the context of resilience. We develop a novel method using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) to identify the age groups in each reef using yearly SL data and then link those age groups over time to identify cohorts and estimate their lifespan. Sixty-four reefs (29%) are deemed to have sufficient data (at least 300 oysters sampled for a minimum of 8 consecutive years) for this analysis. We fit univariate GMMs for each year ($t$) and reef ($r$) for each of the seven river strata ($R$) to estimate 1) the mean and standard deviation of SL for each $a_{Rrt}$th age group, and 2) the mixture percentage of each $a_{Rrt}$th age group. We link age groups across time to infer age cohorts by developing a mechanistic algorithm that prevents the shrinking of shell length when an $a_{Rrt}$th group becomes an ($a_{R,r,t+1}$)th group. Our method shows promise in identifying oyster cohorts and estimating lifespan solely using SL data. Our results show signals of resiliency in almost all river systems: oyster cohorts live longer and grow larger in the mid-to-late 2010s compared to the early 2000s."

These findings suggest that enhanced relative coherence initiates correlated emission and when correlated dephasing is negligible, entanglement and correlated emission become tightly linked in time."

As the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) increases, how to support the reliable flying and effective functioning of UAV swarms is challenging. Recently, the integrated sensing, communication, computing, and control (ISCCC) strategy was designed, which could act as effective physical {\\it reflex arc} links in the intelligent LAWN system. Thus, in this article, we outline the challenges and opportunities when ISCCC meets UAV swarm in LAWN in 6G. First, we propose a three-layer ISCCC structure for the UAV swarm, which is categorized according to the UAV swarm's requirements, i.e., flying, self-organizing, and functioning. Second, for different scenarios, we study the basic problem, promising technologies, and challenges to design ISCCC for UAV swarms. Third, through a case study that minimizes the flying trajectory error of the UAV swarm based on the ISCCC principle, we show that ISCCC is promising to simultaneously improve the reliability and efficiency of LAWN via jointly designing four components. Finally, we discuss the promising directions for the ISCCC-based UAV swarm in LAWN."

Current digital health interventions typically deploy artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain technologies in isolation, missing synergistic opportunities for transformative healthcare delivery. This paper presents IyaCare, a proof-of-concept integrated platform that combines predictive risk assessment, continuous vital sign monitoring, and secure health records management specifically designed for resource-constrained settings. We developed a web-based system with Next.js frontend, Firebase backend, Ethereum blockchain architecture, and XGBoost AI models trained on maternal health datasets. Our feasibility study demonstrates 85.2% accuracy in high-risk pregnancy prediction and validates blockchain data integrity, with key innovations including offline-first functionality and SMS-based communication for community health workers. While limitations include reliance on synthetic validation data and simulated healthcare environments, results confirm the technical feasibility and potential impact of converged digital health solutions. This work contributes a replicable architectural model for integrated maternal health platforms in low-resource settings, advancing progress toward SDG 3.1 targets."

Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements."

Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose \\textbf{ContextAnyone}, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing reference-to-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.

Non-orthogonal MA for DBMC networks (DBMC-NOMA) is a promising option for efficient simultaneous MA using a single molecule type. Expanding significantly upon previous work on the topic, this paper addresses the question of parameter optimization and bit error probability (BEP) reduction in an asynchronous network using DBMC-NOMA. First, we analytically derive the associated BEP and use the result for a thorough comparison with other MA schemes like time-division and molecule-division MA. We show that the asynchronous nature of the system can be exploited for performance gain, and the upper-bound performance can be achieved in all circumstances by avoiding a few worst-case offset configurations. Subsequently, we propose DBMC-aNOMAly, a pilot-symbol-based optimization protocol for asynchronous DBMC-NOMA, and extensively evaluate it using Monte-Carlo simulations. DBMC-aNOMAly is shown to provide robust BEP reduction for different network sizes, noise levels, subjected to sampling jitter, as well as for changing conditions during runtime, particularly, compared to protocols in previous work. DBMC-aNOMAly consists of a set of simple operations such as comparisons and additions, deliberately designed to be implementable with chemical reaction networks, setting up future work on the realistic modeling of the protocol."

This study proposes Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal AutoRegression (M-STAR), a new framework that generates long-term trajectories through a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process. M-STAR combines a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer that encodes hierarchical mobility patterns with a Transformer-based decoder for next-scale autoregressive prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that M-STAR outperforms existing methods in fidelity and significantly improves generation speed.

Building on prior CPU-only approaches, our pipeline combines a single NVIDIA A100 GPU for quantum state construction, followed by N parallel CPU jobs that perform distributed measurement sampling. We validate the fidelity by simulating the 53-qubit, 14-cycle Sycamore circuit and achieving a linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.549, exceeding the published XEB score of 0.002 from Google's reference data. We then evaluate execution time performance with the more complex 53-qubit, 20-cycle circuit, completing the full 2.5 million-shot workload over 100 CPU jobs in 01:15:36, representing a 6.95 x 10^7 speedup compared to Google's original classical estimate. Further, we show that if 1,000 CPU jobs were employed, the estimated duration would be approximately 00:17:35, only 12 minutes slower than the time taken by the original QPU-based experiment. These results illustrate that 'quantum supremacy' is not fixed and continues to be a moving target. In addition, hybrid classical-quantum strategies may provide broader near-term quantum utility than once thought."

While deep learning has greatly enhanced localization accuracy and robustness, existing localization models still face major challenges in cross-scene generalization due to their reliance on scene-specific labeled data. To address this, we introduce Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining (RFRP). This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation. Experimental results show that the RFRP-pretrained LM reduces localization error by over 40% compared to non-pretrained models and by 21% compared to those pretrained using supervised learning."

    "abstract": "Existing image perception methods based on VLMs generally follow a paradigm wherein models extract and analyze image content based on user-provided textual task prompts. However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP."

On the one hand, for non-degenerate SDEs with super-linear drifts, we propose a novel modified Euler scheme and establish the corresponding non-asymptotic convergence bound under the multiplicative type quasi-Wasserstein distance by the aid of the asymptotic reflection by coupling. As a direct application of the theory derived, we explore the non-asymptotic convergence bound of the modified tamed/truncated Euler scheme and, as a byproduct, furnish the associated non-asymptotic convergence rate under the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance although the dissipativity at infinity is not in force. On the other hand, we tackle the non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the Euler scheme corresponding to a kind of degenerate SDEs, where the underdamped Langevin SDE is a typical candidate. To handle such setting, we also appeal to a carefully tailored coupling approach, where the ingredient in the coupling construction lies in that a proper metric and a suitable substitute in the cut-off function and the reflection matrix need to be chosen appropriately. In addition, as a consequent application, the non-asymptotic convergence bound and the $L^1$-Wasserstein convergence rate are revealed for the kinetic Langevin sampler."

We suggest that the morphology of TeV pulsar halos can be used as a novel probe of the properties of interstellar magnetic field around the pulsar, such as the Alfvénic Mach number and the mean direction. We establish a theoretical relation between these quantities and the observational features of the halo's morphology based on the anisotropic diffusion model, and show how X-ray observations of the pulsar halos can further improve the diagnosis of the magnetic field."

By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs). As a result, the lifetime of PBH shortens compared to the zero temperature vacuum and leads to interesting cosmological consequences."

    "abstract": "Error detection (ED), which aims to identify incorrect or inconsistent cell values in tabular data, is important for ensuring data quality. Recent state-of-the-art ED methods leverage the pre-trained knowledge and semantic capability embedded in large language models (LLMs) to directly label whether a cell is erroneous. However, this LLM-as-a-labeler pipeline (1) relies on the black box, implicit decision process, thus failing to provide explainability for the detection results, and (2) is highly sensitive to prompts, yielding inconsistent outputs due to inherent model stochasticity, therefore lacking robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-as-an-inducer framework that adopts LLM to induce the decision tree for ED (termed TreeED) and further ensembles multiple such trees for consensus detection (termed ForestED), thereby improving explainability and robustness. Specifically, based on prompts derived from data context, decision tree specifications and output requirements, TreeED queries the LLM to induce the decision tree skeleton, whose root-to-leaf decision paths specify the stepwise procedure for evaluating a given sample. Each tree contains three types of nodes: (1) rule nodes that perform simple validation checks (e.g., format or range), (2) Graph Neural Network (GNN) nodes that capture complex patterns (e.g., functional dependencies), and (3) leaf nodes that output the final decision types (error or clean). Furthermore, ForestED employs uncertainty-based sampling to obtain multiple row subsets, constructing a decision tree for each subset using TreeED. It then leverages an Expectation-Maximization-based algorithm that jointly estimates tree reliability and optimizes the consensus ED prediction. Extensive xperiments demonstrate that our methods are accurate, explainable and robust, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 16.1% over the best baseline."

    "abstract": "The inflationary $B$-mode signals encode invaluable information about the origin of our Universe and searching for potential signatures of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) is one of the major science goals for future precision observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. However, dominant $B$-mode signals of both Galactic foreground contamination and gravitational lensing effects prevent direct measurements of the PGW $B$-mode signals. There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios. This study will be important for new physics studies with $B$-mode signatures."

    "abstract": "Single-channel audio separation aims to separate individual sources from a single-channel mixture. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with synthetically generated paired data. However, obtaining high-quality paired data in real-world scenarios is often difficult. This data scarcity can degrade model performance under unseen conditions and limit generalization ability. To this end, in this work, we approach this problem from an unsupervised perspective, framing it as a probabilistic inverse problem. Our method requires only diffusion priors trained on individual sources. Separation is then achieved by iteratively guiding an initial state toward the solution through reconstruction guidance. Importantly, we introduce an advanced inverse problem solver specifically designed for separation, which mitigates gradient conflicts caused by interference between the diffusion prior and reconstruction guidance during inverse denoising. This design ensures high-quality and balanced separation performance across individual sources. Additionally, we find that initializing the denoising process with an augmented mixture instead of pure Gaussian noise provides an informative starting point that significantly improves the final performance. To further enhance audio prior modeling, we design a novel time-frequency attention-based network architecture that demonstrates strong audio modeling capability. Collectively, these improvements lead to significant performance gains, as validated across speech-sound event, sound event, and speech separation tasks."

We select a 330-galaxy sample from IllustrisTNG50 (TNG50) matched to 33 FEASTS galaxies by stellar and HI masses, and mock observe them to the FAST resolution and depth at corresponding inclinations and distances for a fair comparison. In contrast to FEASTS, abnormally irregular and extended morphology is found in more than one-third of TNG50 galaxies, especially those massive and HI poor. Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the HI morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass. These results indicate that in TNG50, stellar feedback significantly influences the HI morphology at $10^{18}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback has not so direct a role as expected. With an additional sample from Auriga, we find that the magnetic field may help HI to be more regular in its morphology, while improving the mass resolution does not alleviate the discrepancy from observation.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."

We here extend the work to a more realistic case by including the spin parameter in the system. As in the previous work, we employ the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri method to calculate the systematic bias that can be produced by using noneccentric waveforms in parameter estimation, and we verify the reliability of the method by comparing it with numerical Bayesian parameter estimation results. We generate $10^4$ BNS sources randomly distributed in the parameter space $m_1$-$m_2$-$χ_{\\rm eff}$-$e_0$, where the nuetron star mass is in the range of $1 M_\\odot \\leq m_{1,2}\\leq 2M_\\odot (m_2 \\leq m_1)$, the effective spin is $-0.2 \\leq χ_{\\rm eff} \\leq0 .2$, and the eccentricity (at the reference frequency 10 Hz) is $0 \\leq e_0 \\leq 0.024$. For the true value of the tidal deformability ($λ$) of neutron stars, we assume the equation of state model APR4. For all gravitational-wave signals emitted from the sources, we calculate the systematic biases ($Δθ$) for the chirp mass ($M_c$), symmetric mass ratio ($η$), effective spin ($χ_{\\rm eff}$), and effective tidal deformability ($\\tildeλ$), and obtain generalized distributions of the biases. The distribution of biases in $M_c, η$, and $χ_{\\rm eff}$ shows narrow bands that increase or decrease quadratically with increasing $e_0$, indicating a weak dependence of biases on the three parameters. On the other hand, the biases of $\\tildeλ$ are widely distributed depending on the values of the mass and spin parameters at a given $e_0$. We investigate the implications of biased parameters for the inference of neutron star properties by performing Bayesian parameter estimation for specific cases."

MMRPT constructs masked multimodal data by estimating sentence-level visual dependency via attention over visual tokens and masking highly vision-dependent segments; the model reconstructs these spans through vision-grounded reasoning guided by a semantic-visual reward. Experiments show consistent zero-shot gains across diverse benchmarks and substantially improved robustness under supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating that reinforcement-driven masked reasoning provides a more reliable and generalizable pre-training objective for multimodal models."

We then turn to the fBM setting and derive a local upper bound for the joint density in terms of the control distance.

MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions.

However, a critical vulnerability persists: user privacy during file retrieval remains largely unaddressed, risking the exposure of sensitive information. To overcome this, we introduce PIR-DSN, the first DSN protocol to integrate Private Information Retrieval (PIR) for both single and multi-server settings. Our key innovations include a novel secure mapping method that transforms sparse file identifiers into compact integer indexes, enabling both public verifiability of file operations and efficient private retrieval. Furthermore, PIR-DSN guarantees Byzantine-robust private retrieval through file replication across multiple miners. We implement and rigorously evaluate PIR-DSN against three prominent industrial DSN systems. Experimental results demonstrate that PIR-DSN achieves comparable overhead for file upload and deletion. While PIR inherently introduces an additional computational cost leading to higher retrieval latency, PIR-DSN maintains comparable throughput. These findings underscore PIR-DSN's practical viability for privacy-sensitive applications within DSN environments."

The survey instruments were adapted from similar studies and suitably modified to suit the context. Using exploratory factor analysis, 18 measurement items converged into six factors, namely attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, optimism, innovativeness and range anxiety. We confirmed the reliability and validity of the constructs using Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability, average variance extracted and discriminant validity analysis. We explored the relationship between them using structural equation modelling. All factors but Optimism were found to be significantly associated with adoption intention. We further employed mediation analysis to examine the mediation pathways. The TPB components mediated the effect of innovativeness but not range anxiety. The study's insights can help policymakers and marketers design targeted interventions that address consumer concerns, reshape consumer perceptions, and foster greater EV adoption. The interventions can target increasing the mediating variables or decreasing range anxiety to facilitate a smoother transition to sustainable transportation."

Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of < 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications."

Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

Approach: We outline the need for ultrasensitive detectors for biophotonics, summarize SNSPD operating principles and compare their performance with established photon-counting devices. We highlight applications in which SNSPDs enable new imaging capabilities and discuss system-level challenges and technological developments that are critical to future applications, including clinical translation.

Advances in scalable arrays, cryogenic miniaturization, and improved signal collection are reducing barriers to widespread adoption. Conclusions: SNSPDs are poised to transform photon-limited biomedical imaging. As device performance and system integration continue to advance, their adoption in imaging platforms is expected to accelerate.

To address these limitations, we propose Mimir, a novel hierarchical dual-system framework capable of generating robust trajectories relying on goal points with uncertainty estimation: (1) Unlike previous approaches that deterministically model, we estimate goal point uncertainty with a Laplace distribution to enhance robustness; (2) To overcome the slow inference speed of the guidance system, we introduce a multi-rate guidance mechanism that predicts extended goal points in advance. Validated on challenging Navhard and Navtest benchmarks, Mimir surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods with a 20% improvement in the driving score EPDMS, while achieving 1.6 times improvement in high-level module inference speed without compromising accuracy.

    "abstract": "Urban sensing is essential for the development of smart cities, enabling monitoring, computing, and decision-making for urban management.Thanks to the advent of vehicle technologies, modern vehicles are transforming from solely mobility tools to valuable sensors for urban data collection, and hold the potential of improving traffic congestion, transport sustainability, and infrastructure inspection.Vehicle-based sensing is increasingly recognized as a promising technology due to its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and extensive spatiotemporal coverage. However, optimizing sensing strategies to balance spatial and temporal coverage, minimize redundancy, and address budget constraints remains a key challenge.This study proposes an adaptive framework for enhancing the sensing utility of sensor-equipped vehicles.By integrating heterogeneous open-source data, the framework leverages spatiotemporal weighting to optimize vehicle selection and sensing coverage across various urban contexts.An entropy-based vehicle selection strategy, \\texttt{Improved OptiFleet}, is developed to maximize sensing utility while minimizing redundancy.The framework is validated using real-world air quality data from 320 sensor-equipped vehicles operating in Guangzhou, China, over two months.Key findings show that the proposed method outperforms baseline strategies, providing up to 5\\% higher sensing utility with reduced fleet sizes, and also highlights the critical role of dynamic urban data in optimizing mobile sensing strategies."

    "abstract": "Copy-move image forgery aims to duplicate certain objects or to hide specific contents with copy-move operations, which can be achieved by a sequence of manual manipulations as well as up-to-date deep generative network-based swapping. Its detection is becoming increasingly challenging for the complex transformations and fine-tuned operations on the tampered regions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream model, namely Multi-directional Similarity Network (MSN), to accurate and efficient copy-move forgery detection. It addresses the two major limitations of existing deep detection models in \\textbf{representation} and \\textbf{localization}, respectively. In representation, an image is hierarchically encoded by a multi-directional CNN network, and due to the diverse augmentation in scales and rotations, the feature achieved better measures the similarity between sampled patches in two streams. In localization, we design a 2-D similarity matrix based decoder, and compared with the current 1-D similarity vector based one, it makes full use of spatial information in the entire image, leading to the improvement in detecting tampered regions. Beyond the method, a new forgery database generated by various deep neural networks is presented, as a new benchmark for detecting the growing deep-synthesized copy-move. Extensive experiments are conducted on two classic image forensics benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.} CASIA CMFD and CoMoFoD, and the newly presented one. The state-of-the-art results are reported, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%. These findings indicate that progress requires hybrid architectures with affinity-aligned modules. We release our validated taxonomy,"

The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors."

This involves appealing to symmetries to make a principled distinction between properties of a system which are meaningful only relative to an external reference system and properties which are meaningful without further relativization. Thus we may propose that there are always well-defined facts about what observers have observed, but there are not necessarily well-defined facts about the relations between their reference frames, so there will not always exist a joint distribution over their outcomes which can meaningfully be compared to the predictions of quantum mechanics. In addition, this approach also offers a general argument against the idea that there should be a regress of relativization."

This paper presents TagLabel, an RFID based system that determines both the orientation and contents of packages using low cost passive UHF tags. By analyzing how materials change RSSI and phase, the system identifies the contents of a package without opening it. Using orientation inferred from phase differences, tag occlusion, and antenna gain patterns, the system selects the tag with the greatest occlusion for accurate material sensing. We evaluate two and three tag configurations, and show that both can deliver high orientation and material sensing performance through the use of machine learning classifiers, even in realistic RF environments. When combined into a unified pipeline, TagLabel achieves more than 80 percent accuracy across all package orientations. Because it requires only standard RFID hardware and offers fast scanning times, this approach provides a practical way to enhance package inspection and improve automation in logistics operations."

    "abstract": "Microscopic inhomogeneity within superconducting films is a critical bottleneck hindering the performance and scalability of quantum circuits. All-nitride Josephson Junctions (JJs) have attracted substantial attention for their potential to provide enhanced coherence times and enable higher temperature operation. However, their performance is often limited by local variations caused by polymorphism, impurities, and interface quality. This work diagnoses atomic-scale limitations preventing superconducting NbN/AlN/NbN JJs from reaching their full potential. Electrical measurements reveal suppressed critical current density and soft onset of quasiparticle current. However, inverse proportionality between resistance and junction area confirms homogenous barrier thickness. This isolates structural and chemical variations in electrodes and barrier as the source of performance limitation. The observed characteristics are attributed to complex materials problems: NbN polymorphism, phase coexistence, and oxygen impurities. Using advanced microscopy and machine learning integrated approach, nanoscale inclusions of epsilon-Nb2N2 are found to coexist within dominant delta-NbN electrodes. DC performance of JJs may be affected by these defects, leading to unresolved supercurrent and soft transition to normal state. By identifying specific atomic scale defects, tracing its origin to initial film nucleation, and linking to its detrimental electrical signature, this work establishes a material-to-device correlation and provides targeted strategy for phase engineering towards reproducible, high coherence and scalable quantum devices."

    "abstract": "Stabilizer simulation of Clifford quantum circuits - error-correction circuits, Clifford subroutines, etc. - on classical computers has played a central role in our understanding of circuit performance. The stabilizer description, however, restricts the accessible noise one can incorporate into the simulation to Pauli-type noise. More general noise, including coherent errors, may have more severe impact on circuit performance than Pauli noise; yet, such general noise have been difficult to access, much less investigate fully, in numerical simulations. Here, through the use of stratified importance sampling, we show how general noise can be simulated within the stabilizer formalism in reasonable time, with non-unitary noise being nearly as cheap as Pauli noise. Unitary (or coherent) noise can require an order of magnitude more time for the simulation, but nevertheless completes in very reasonable times, a drastic improvement over past approaches that typically fail to converge altogether. Our work thus enables detailed beyond-Pauli understanding of circuit performance in the presence of real device noise, which is rarely Pauli in nature. Among other examples, we present direct simulation results for the performance of the popular rotated planar surface codes under circuit-level general noise, previously available only in limited situations and/or through mappings to efficiently simulatable physical models."

    "abstract": "Agentic LLM frameworks promise autonomous behavior via task decomposition, tool use, and iterative planning, but most deployed systems remain brittle. They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime."

While robotic systems have been developed for tasks such as powder grinding and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, fully automating powder handling at the milligram scale remains a significant challenge due to the complex flow dynamics of powders and the diversity of laboratory tasks. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel, funnel-shaped, flexible robotic hand that preserves the softness and conical sheet designs in prior work while incorporating a controllable valve at the cone apex to enable precise, incremental dispensing of milligram-scale powder quantities. The hand is integrated with an external balance through a feedback control system based on a model of powder flow and online parameter identification. Experimental evaluations with glass beads, monosodium glutamate, and titanium dioxide demonstrated that 80% of the trials achieved an error within 2 mg, and the maximum error observed was approximately 20 mg across a target range of 20 mg to 3 g. In addition, by incorporating flow prediction models commonly used for hoppers and performing online parameter identification, the system is able to adapt to variations in powder dynamics. Compared to direct PID control, the proposed model-based control significantly improved both accuracy and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of the proposed system to enable efficient and flexible powder weighing, with scalability toward larger quantities and applicability to a broad range of laboratory automation tasks."

The objective is to minimize the sum of agent-specific composite convex functions over agent-specific private constraint sets. Unlike existing decentralized primal-dual methods that require knowledge of the Lipschitz constants, D-APDB automatically adapts to local smoothness by employing a distributed backtracking step-size search. Each agent relies only on first-order oracles associated with its own objective and constraint functions and on local communications with the neighboring agents, without any prior knowledge of Lipschitz constants. We establish $\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence guarantees for sub-optimality, infeasibility and consensus violation, under standard assumptions on smoothness and on the connectivity of the communication graph. To our knowledge, when nodes have private constraints, especially when they are nonlinear convex constraints onto which projections are not cheap to compute, D-APDB is the first distributed method with backtracking that achieves the optimal convergence rate for the class of constrained composite convex optimization problems. We also provide numerical results for D-APDB on a distributed QCQP problem illustrating the potential performance gains that can be achieved by D-APDB."

The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities."

Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring."

Our method treats text and non-text regions separately, refining text regions first and merging them with non-text regions later for full-scene optimization. STRinGS produces sharp, readable text even in challenging configurations. We introduce a text readability measure OCR Character Error Rate (CER) to evaluate the efficacy on text regions. STRinGS results in a 63.6% relative improvement over 3DGS at just 7K iterations. We also introduce a curated dataset STRinGS-360 with diverse text scenarios to evaluate text readability in 3D reconstruction.

We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk.

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Stack Overflow, have changed and impacted the software development practice. In these platforms, developers share and reuse their software development and programming experience. Therefore, a plethora of research work focused on crowdsourcing in software engineering and showed that, among other things, crowdsourced development tends to increase developers' productivity and reduce time-to-market. However, in crowdsourcing, the empirical studies of software quality are lacking, and simple questions, such as what developers use the crowdsourcing knowledge for, are unanswered. Therefore, our research focused on studying the impact of reusing crowdsourcing knowledge on software projects. To do so, we conduct several large-scale empirical studies on some of the well-known crowdsourcing platforms, including Stack Overflow and npm. Our results showed that reusing knowledge from these crowdsourcing platforms has the potential to assist software development practice, specifically in the form of reusing crowdsourced code. However, using such knowledge affects the quality of the software in several aspects, such as making the software projects suffer from dependency overhead and increasing the maintenance effort. Based on these findings, we use the gained knowledge to make sound data-driven decisions where we examine software quality assurance methods to mitigate the risk of relying on crowd sourcing knowledge in software development. We examine the use of continuous integration (CI). Our analysis showed how CI can be improved to increase developers' productivity and save their resources."

    "abstract": "We present a control framework that enables humanoid robots to perform collaborative transportation tasks with a human partner. The framework supports both translational and rotational motions, which are fundamental to co-transport scenarios. It comprises three components: a high-level planner, a low-level controller, and a stiffness modulation mechanism. At the planning level, we introduce the Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP), which, combined with an admittance model and an MPC formulation, generates dynamically feasible footstep plans. These are executed by a QP-based whole-body controller that accounts for the coupled humanoid-object dynamics. Stiffness modulation regulates robot-object interaction, ensuring convergence to the desired relative configuration defined by the distance between the object and the robot's center of mass. We validate the effectiveness of the framework through real-world experiments conducted on the Digit humanoid platform. To quantify collaboration quality, we propose an efficiency metric that captures both task performance and inter-agent coordination. We show that this metric highlights the role of compliance in collaborative tasks and offers insights into desirable trajectory characteristics across both high- and low-level control layers. Finally, we showcase experimental results on collaborative behaviors, including translation, turning, and combined motions such as semi circular trajectories, representative of naturally occurring co-transportation tasks."

Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice."

For polynomial nonlinearities of degree at most $D$, we show that the moments of AMP iterates match their state evolution predictions for $t \\lesssim \\frac{\\log N}{D\\log D}$ iterations.

The second protocol updates parameters after collecting measurements from definite-outcome circuits (e.g.~syndrome extraction circuits for quantum error correction), balancing efficiency with classical control overheads. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that both methods can calibrate 1- and 2-qubit gates rapidly and accurately even in the presence of decoherence, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and parameter drift. We propose and demonstrate effective adaptive strategies for tuning the hyperparameters of both protocols. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time in-situ calibration of qubits performing quantum error correction, using only syndrome data, via numerical simulations of syndrome extraction in the [[5,1,3]] code."

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution to improve readout accuracy . Prior hardware implementations of DNN-based readout are resource-intensive and suffer from high inference latency, limiting their practical use in low-latency decoding and quantum error correction (QEC) loops. This paper proposes LUNA, a fast and efficient superconducting qubit readout accelerator that combines low-cost integrator-based preprocessing with Look-Up Table (LUT) based neural networks for classification. The architecture uses simple integrators for dimensionality reduction with minimal hardware overhead, and employs LogicNets (DNNs synthesized into LUT logic) to drastically reduce resource usage while enabling ultra-low-latency inference. We integrate this with a differential evolution based exploration and optimization framework to identify high-quality design points. Our results show up to a 10.95x reduction in area and 30% lower latency with little to no loss in fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art. LUNA enables scalable, low-footprint, and high-speed qubit readout, supporting the development of larger and more reliable quantum computing systems."

Using the Higgs boson diphoton cross-section measurement as a case study with ATLAS Open Data, we design a hybrid system that combines an LLM-based supervisor-coder agent with the Snakemake workflow manager. In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows. To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models. While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation. Although we set the temperature to zero, other sampling parameters (e.g., top-p, top-k) remained at their defaults, and some reasoning-oriented models internally adjust these settings. Consequently, the models do not produce fully deterministic results. This study establishes the first LLM-agent-driven automated data-analysis framework in HEP, enabling systematic benchmarking of model capabilities, stability, and limitations in real-world scientific computing environments.

    "abstract": "Recent reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have yielded impressive reasoning improvements in language models, yet it remains unclear whether post-training truly extends a model's reasoning ability beyond what it acquires during pre-training. A central challenge is the lack of control in modern training pipelines: large-scale pre-training corpora are opaque, mid-training is often underexamined, and RL objectives interact with unknown prior knowledge in complex ways. To resolve this ambiguity, we develop a fully controlled experimental framework that isolates the causal contributions of pre-training, mid-training, and RL-based post-training. Our approach employs synthetic reasoning tasks with explicit atomic operations, parseable step-by-step reasoning traces, and systematic manipulation of training distributions. We evaluate models along two axes: extrapolative generalization to more complex compositions and contextual generalization across surface contexts. Using this framework, we reconcile competing views on RL's effectiveness. We show that: 1) RL produces true capability gains (pass@128) only when pre-training leaves sufficient headroom and when RL data target the model's edge of competence, tasks at the boundary that are difficult but not yet out of reach. 2) Contextual generalization requires minimal yet sufficient pre-training exposure, after which RL can reliably transfer. 3) Mid-training significantly enhances performance under fixed compute compared with RL only, demonstrating its central but underexplored role in training pipelines. 4) Process-level rewards reduce reward hacking and improve reasoning fidelity. Together, these results clarify the interplay between pre-training, mid-training, and RL, offering a foundation for understanding and improving reasoning LM training strategies."

Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \\textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

    "abstract": "Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories."

    "abstract": "Generative diffusion models for end-to-end autonomous driving often suffer from mode collapse, tending to generate conservative and homogeneous behaviors. While DiffusionDrive employs predefined anchors representing different driving intentions to partition the action space and generate diverse trajectories, its reliance on imitation learning lacks sufficient constraints, resulting in a dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality. In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration. Second, we employ intra-anchor GRPO to manage advantage estimation among samples generated from a single anchor, and inter-anchor truncated GRPO to incorporate a global perspective across different anchors, preventing improper advantage comparisons between distinct intentions (e.g., turning vs. going straight), which can lead to further mode collapse. DiffusionDriveV2 achieves 91.2 PDMS on the NAVSIM v1 dataset and 85.5 EPDMS on the NAVSIM v2 dataset in closed-loop evaluation with an aligned ResNet-34 backbone, setting a new record. Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

    "abstract": "Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

We then define a reward function based on this statistic and employ a genetic algorithm to search for spectra that maximize the reward. A key advantage of our framework is that it does not rely on unitarity. We illustrate the method using Virasoro blocks with central charge $c<1$, where the optimal solutions align with the known minimal models.

    "abstract": "The standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework assumes a Brownian noise process and relies on classical stochastic calculus tools, such as those based on Itô calculus. In this paper, we solve a generalized linear quadratic optimal control problem where the process and measurement noises can be non-Markovian and non-semimartingale stochastic processes with sample paths that have low Hölder regularity. Since these noise models do not, in general, permit the use of the standard Itô calculus, we employ rough path theory to formulate and solve the problem. By leveraging signature representations and controlled rough paths, we derive the optimal state estimation and control strategies."

    "abstract": "Understanding articulated objects is a fundamental challenge in robotics and digital twin creation. To effectively model such objects, it is essential to recover both part segmentation and the underlying joint parameters. Despite the importance of this task, previous work has largely focused on setups like multi-view systems, object scanning, or static cameras. In this paper, we present the first data-driven approach that jointly predicts part segmentation and joint parameters from monocular video captured with a freely moving camera. Trained solely on synthetic data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world objects, offering a scalable and practical solution for articulated object understanding. Our approach operates directly on casually recorded video, making it suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments. Project webpage: https://aartykov.github.io/sim2art/"

    "abstract": "This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed. (Abridged)"

However, JWST transit observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets show significant contamination from stellar surface features that we are unable to confidently model. Here, we present the motivation and first observations of our JWST multi-cycle program of TRAPPIST-1 e, which utilize close transits of the airless TRAPPIST-1 b to model-independently correct for stellar contamination, with the goal of determining whether TRAPPIST-1 e has an Earth-like mean molecular weight atmosphere containing CO$_2$. We present our simulations, which show that with the 15 close transit observations, we will be able to detect this atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e at $Δ\\ln\\,Z=5$ or greater confidence assuming we are able to correct for stellar contamination using the close transit observations. We also show the first three observations of our program. We find that our ability to correct for stellar contamination can be inhibited when strong stellar flares are present, as flares can break the assumption that the star does not change meaningfully between planetary transits. The cleanest observation demonstrates the removal of stellar contamination contribution through an increased preference for a flat line over the original TRAPPIST-1 e spectrum, but highlights how minor data analysis assumptions can propagate significantly when searching for small atmospheric signals. This is amplified when using the signals from multiple planets, which is important to consider as we continue our atmospheric search."

We derive new constraints on this active-sterile neutrino polarizability from its contribution to neutrino-nucleus scattering with a single photon in the final state at neutrino experiments. We show that a realization of this operator via a light mediator can explain the MiniBooNE low-energy excess while remaining consistent with other experimental constraints. Finally, we comment on additional model realizations of this higher-dimensional operator."

While these models often produce linguistically coherent output, they often suffer from hallucinations, generating descriptions that are factually inconsistent with the visual content, potentially leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, the assessment of hallucinations in MLLM has become increasingly crucial in the model development process. Contemporary methodologies predominantly depend on external LLM evaluators, which are themselves susceptible to hallucinations and may present challenges in terms of domain adaptation. In this study, we propose the hypothesis that hallucination manifests as measurable irregularities within the internal layer dynamics of MLLMs, not merely due to distributional shifts but also in the context of layer-wise analysis of specific assumptions. By incorporating such modifications, \\textsc{\\textsc{HalluShift++}} broadens the efficacy of hallucination detection from text-based large language models (LLMs) to encompass multimodal scenarios.

Traditionally, this result is obtained as a consequence of very powerful and general techniques of Nash-Williams. In this paper, we propose a new proof of this result that is based on an explicit characterization of the underlying orders. In particular, this new technique allows us to formalize the proof of the result in the formal theory $\\mathsf{atr}_0$, thus resolving a long-standing open problem in the field of reverse mathematics. The main ingredient of our proof is the introduction of a transfinite hierarchy of orders $\\dot I^*_α(P)$ starting with $\\dot I^*_0(P)=P$ and $\\dot I^*_{α+1}(P)$ being the inclusion order on ideals of $\\dot I^*_α(P)$. On one hand, we show that a quasi-order $P$ is a bqo if and only if all $\\dot I^*_α(P)$ are wqos. On the other hand, under the assumption that $P$ is a bqo, we show that the $\\dot I^*_α(P^{<ω})$ are wqos, and furthermore give a characterization of their structure in terms of a transfinite iteration of a Higman-like construction. The sufficiently explicit character of this proof allows us to formalize it in a rather straightforward manner."

Experiments demonstrate reliable gripping up to 90 degrees of body roll and inclination, while effective climbing on branches inclined up to 67.5 degrees, achieving a maximum speed of 0.55 body lengths per second on horizontal branches. The compliant tracks allow yaw steering of up to 10 degrees, enhancing maneuverability on irregular surfaces. Power measurements show efficient operation with a dimensionless cost of transport over an order of magnitude lower than typical hovering power consumption in aerial robots. Integrated within a drone-tether deployment system, the crawler provides a robust, low-power platform for environmental sampling and in-canopy sensing, bridging the gap between aerial and surface-based ecological robotics."

In this work, we study SGD's impact on generalization through the lens of the statistical bootstrap: SGD uses gradient variability under batch sampling as a proxy for solution variability under the randomness of the data collection process. We use empirical results and theoretical analysis to substantiate this claim. In idealized experiments on empirical risk minimization, we show that SGD is drawn to parameter choices that are robust under resampling and thus avoids spurious solutions even if they lie in wider and deeper minima of the training loss. We prove rigorously that by implicitly regularizing the trace of the gradient covariance matrix, SGD controls the algorithmic variability. This regularization leads to solutions that are less sensitive to sampling noise, thereby improving generalization. Numerical experiments on neural network training show that explicitly incorporating the estimate of the algorithmic variability as a regularizer improves test performance. This fact supports our claim that bootstrap estimation underpins SGD's generalization advantages."

Previous efforts in representation learning do not attempt to jointly capture structured periodic patterns and irregular variations in human and animal movement. To address this, we present Multi-Domain Motion Embedding (MDME), a motion representation that unifies the embedding of structured and unstructured features using a wavelet-based encoder and a probabilistic embedding in parallel. This produces a rich representation of reference motions from a minimal input set, enabling improved generalization across diverse motion styles and morphologies. We evaluate MDME on retargeting-free real-time motion imitation by conditioning robot control policies on the learned embeddings, demonstrating accurate reproduction of complex trajectories on both humanoid and quadruped platforms. Our comparative studies confirm that MDME outperforms prior approaches in reconstruction fidelity and generalizability to unseen motions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDME can reproduce novel motion styles in real-time through zero-shot deployment, eliminating the need for task-specific tuning or online retargeting. These results position MDME as a generalizable and structure-aware foundation for scalable real-time robot imitation."

Unlike many prior egocentric datasets that focus on indoor tasks or exclude eye gaze information, our work emphasizes visual attention while subjects walk in outdoor campus paths. Using this data, we develop EgoCampusNet, a novel method to predict eye gaze of navigating pedestrians as they move through outdoor environments. Our contributions provide both a new resource for studying real-world attention and a resource for future work in gaze prediction models for navigation.

In this formulation, the fermion-soliton energy is proportional to the soliton's topological charge. We show that fermionic back-reaction and the self-interacting scalar critically shape the fermion-kink energy, the in-gap bound-state spectrum, and the fermionic vacuum-polarization energy, yielding well-defined stability minima of the total energy as functions of the fermion and scalar masses and coupling parameters. A key result is that the Heun-equation formalism is necessary to construct nonzero-energy bound and scattering states: unlike the tau-function method, which captures only the zero mode, the Heun approach encodes the full scattering data through local solution matching conditions. These results refine the spectral analysis of deformed integrable models. The stability of soliton-fermion configurations has direct implications for topologically protected states in quantum information and condensed-matter systems."

However, how to efficiently utilize and scale up computational resources during test time remains underexplored, which can prove to be a scaling-efficient approach and bring orthogonal improvements in LM domains. The key point in applying test-time scaling to DLRS lies in effectively generating diverse yet meaningful outputs for the same instance. We propose two ways: One is to explore the heterogeneity of different model architectures. The other is to utilize the randomness of model initialization under a homogeneous architecture. The evaluation is conducted across eight models, including both classic and SOTA models, on three benchmarks. Sufficient evidence proves the effectiveness of both solutions. We further prove that under the same inference budget, test-time scaling can outperform parameter scaling. Our test-time scaling can also be seamlessly accelerated with the increase in parallel servers when deployed online, without affecting the inference time on the user side. Code is available."

    "abstract": "We present a dynamical-systems perspective on wave breaking for ideal incompressible free-surface flows. By tracking the most energetic hotspot on the wave surface, we find that near breaking the surface slope m evolves on a fast timescale governed by the small parameter epsilon = (partial_z u)^(-1), the inverse vertical velocity gradient at the hotspot, while the focusing parameter A = (U - Ce)/(U - Creq) varies slowly and adiabatically. Here U is the horizontal fluid velocity at the energetic point, Ce its propagation speed, and Creq the equivalent crest speed. This slow-fast structure reveals a fold catastrophe in the (m, A) space whose boundary forms the geometric skeleton organizing the dynamics near breaking. Finite-time blowup occurs when the trajectory crosses this boundary, marking the onset of breaking. The inception of breaking is further characterized by crossing the slope threshold theta* = arctan(sqrt(2) - 1) = 22.5 degrees. This critical angle marks the maximum anisotropy that can be sustained between the Hessians of the velocity and pressure fields, reflecting an imbalance between kinetic and potential energy fluxes. The anisotropy of the velocity Hessian also gives rise to the classical 30-degree slope observed at the inflection point of steep waves near breaking inception. The crest height is limited by the maximum excess of kinetic over potential energy that the flow can sustain, beyond which breaking becomes inevitable. Wave breaking can also be interpreted as a gravity analogue of a collapsing black hole, with apparent and event horizons representing the onset and inception of breaking."

For location estimation, we establish an upper bound on the estimation error of the location halfspace median under the Huber contamination model. An analogous result for the standard scatter halfspace median matrix is feasible only under the assumption of elliptical symmetry, as ellipticity is deeply embedded in the definition of scatter halfspace depth. To address this limitation, we propose a modified scatter halfspace depth that better accommodates α-symmetric distributions, and derive an upper bound for the corresponding α-scatter median matrix.

Allowing temperature dependent masses for the fermions, we show that above a critical temperature $T_c$ the quark mass has to drop rapidly in order to obtain energy density values compatible with the Lattice-QCD results. Within this framework, thus, the restoration of chiral symmetry in the system is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gluon variance -- which is a fundamental quantity of the NAQPM -- is strongly correlated to the fermion mass and decreases by orders of magnitude through the transition. The high temperature phenomenological characteristics of the gluon appear consistent to properties of the perturbative QCD gluon. The model indicates that color deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are interrelated and classical configurations of the QCD dynamics play an important role to the criticality of the system."

By introducing the auxiliary bad cavity and exploiting the nonreciprocal condition, this model can harness the environmental dissipation to suppress the reverse energy transfer. Under resonant conditions, we have achieved a four ratio of the battery energy to the charger energy; in contrast, this ratio is significantly reduced under large detuning. Through damping optimization, high efficiency of the short-time charging power is attained. In comparison to the fully nonreciprocal scheme, the QB operating at the exceptional point (EP) exhibits greater resilience to parameter fluctuations. These findings highlight the potential of NH quantum engineering for advancing QB technology, particularly in regimes involving directional energy transfer, controlled dissipation, and entropy management in open quantum systems."

    "abstract": "The conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) is fundamentally limited by the local minima issue and its inability to account for the kinematics of moving obstacles. This paper addresses the critical challenge of autonomous collision avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic and cluttered airspace by proposing a novel Direction and Relative Velocity Weighted Artificial Potential Field (APF). In this approach, a bounded weighting function, $ω(θ,v_{e})$, is introduced to dynamically scale the repulsive potential based on the direction and velocity of the obstacle relative to the UAV. This robust APF formulation is integrated within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate collision-free trajectories while adhering to kinematic constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves local minima and significantly enhances safety by enabling smooth, predictive avoidance maneuvers. The system ensures superior path integrity and reliable performance, confirming its viability for autonomous navigation in complex environments."

    "abstract": "We introduce \\emph{Metric-Fair Prompting}, a fairness-aware prompting framework that guides large language models (LLMs) to make decisions under metric-fairness constraints. In the application of multiple-choice medical question answering, each {(question, option)} pair is treated as a binary instance with label $+1$ (correct) or $-1$ (incorrect). To promote {individual fairness}~--~treating similar instances similarly~--~we compute question similarity using NLP embeddings and solve items in \\emph{joint pairs of similar questions} rather than in isolation. The prompt enforces a global decision protocol: extract decisive clinical features, map each \\((\\text{question}, \\text{option})\\) to a score $f(x)$ that acts as confidence, and impose a Lipschitz-style constraint so that similar inputs receive similar scores and, hence, consistent outputs. Evaluated on the {MedQA (US)} benchmark, Metric-Fair Prompting is shown to improve performance over standard single-item prompting, demonstrating that fairness-guided, confidence-oriented reasoning can enhance LLM accuracy on high-stakes clinical multiple-choice questions."

    "abstract": "Active learning improves annotation efficiency by selecting the most informative samples for annotation and model training. While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.

In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3's 3D reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while zero-shot evaluations on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes."

    "abstract": "A persistence diagram is a finite multiset of birth-death pairs representing the lifetimes of topological features across a filtration. Persistence diagrams do not carry intrinsic spectral or kernel structures, so applications typically use auxiliary vectorizations of diagrams. Virtual persistence diagrams, given by the Grothendieck completion of finite diagrams with the $W_1$ metric, yield a group structure with additive cancellation and a translation-invariant metric. For a finite metric pair $(X,d,A)$ we use the identification $K(X,A)\\cong \\mathbb Z^{|X\\setminus A|}$ and parametrize its Pontryagin dual torus. The Lipschitz seminorms of characters in the $W_1$ geometry are expressed in terms of edgewise phase differences on the quotient $X/A$. A weighted graph Laplacian on $X/A$ determines a Dirichlet symbol $λ(θ)$, and the corresponding heat spectral multipliers induce translation-invariant kernels and their reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces. We obtain explicit global $W_1$-Lipschitz bounds for all functions in these spaces. Random Fourier feature maps are constructed by sampling from the heat measures; they are unbiased kernel approximations and satisfy asymptotic Lipschitz estimates based on the same spectral quantities. We apply these kernels and their finite-dimensional approximations in a synthetic segmentation experiment that compares baseline, Wasserstein, and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)-based losses."

First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter.

We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points). These results reveal both the limitations of current VLMs and the effectiveness of domain adaptation.

Despite significant advances in deep learning for image processing, existing methods have yet to effectively address the challenges of irregular lesion shapes and low contrast. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative encoder-decoder network architecture based on multi-scale residual structures, capable of extracting rich feature information from different receptive fields to effectively identify lesion areas. By introducing a Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Fusion (MRCF) module, our method captures cross-scale features, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the extracted information. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Mix Attention Module (CMAM), which redefines the attention scope and dynamically calculates weights across multiple contexts, thus improving the flexibility and depth of feature capture and enabling deeper exploration of subtle features. To overcome the information loss caused by skip connections in traditional U-Net, an External Attention Bridge (EAB) is introduced, facilitating the effective utilization of information in the decoder and compensating for the loss during upsampling. Extensive experimental evaluations on several skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing transformer and convolutional neural network-based models, showcasing exceptional segmentation accuracy and robustness."

Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy on heavily hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, which hosts an s $\\pm$ is superconducting state, we reveal a previously unobserved coupling between a surface CDW and TRSB superconductivity. Experimentally, the TRSB superconductivity imparts \"chirality\" to the CDW, which manifests as commensurate domains separated by domain walls with $π$-phase slips-forming what we term a bipolar CDW. The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $δ$ $φ$ = $π$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems."

Our systematic comparison of cascaded versus end-to-end architectures shows that while IndicWhisper + IndicMT achieves the highest performance due to extensive Telugu-specific training data, finetuned SeamlessM4T models demonstrate remarkable competitiveness despite using significantly less Telugu-specific training data. This finding suggests that with careful hyperparameter tuning and sufficient parallel data (potentially less than 100 hours), end-to-end systems can achieve performance comparable to cascaded approaches in low-resource settings. Our metric reliability study evaluating BLEU, METEOR, ChrF++, ROUGE-L, TER, and BERTScore against human judgments reveals that traditional metrics provide better quality discrimination than BERTScore for Telugu--English translation.

    "abstract": "Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) is a powerful formal method for automatically generating specifications of discrete event systems. However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the highly specialized nature of formal models written in languages such as FSP and FLTL. In practice, syntax errors in modeling frequently become an important bottleneck for developers-not only disrupting the workflow and reducing productivity, but also diverting attention from higher-level semantic design. To this end, this paper presents an automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair syntax errors in DCS models using a well-designed, knowledge-informed prompting strategy. Specifically, the prompting is derived from a systematic empirical study of common error patterns, identified through expert interviews and student workshops. It equips the LLM with DCS-specific domain knowledge, including formal grammar rules and illustrative examples, to guide accurate corrections. To evaluate our method, we constructed a new benchmark by systematically injecting realistic syntax errors into validated DCS models. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of repair accuracy and its practical utility regarding time, achieving a speedup of 3.46 times compared to human developers.

    "abstract": "Endoscopic surgery relies on intraoperative video, making image quality a decisive factor for surgical safety and efficacy. Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of degradation-aware modeling for real-time endoscopic video enhancement. Nevertheless, our method suggests that implicitly learning and propagating degradation representation offer a practical pathway for clinical application."

This conflates policy performance with motion difficulty, obscuring whether failures stem from poor learning or inherently challenging motions. In this work, we address this gap with Motion Difficulty Score (MDS), a novel metric that defines and quantifies imitation difficulty independent of policy performance. Grounded in rigid-body dynamics, MDS interprets difficulty as the torque variation induced by small pose perturbations: larger torque-to-pose variation yields flatter reward landscapes and thus higher learning difficulty. MDS captures this through three properties of the perturbation-induced torque space: volume, variance, and temporal variability. We also use it to construct MD-AMASS, a difficulty-aware repartitioning of the AMASS dataset. Empirically, we rigorously validate MDS by demonstrating its explanatory power on the performance of state-of-the-art motion imitation policies. We further demonstrate the utility of MDS through two new MDS-based metrics: Maximum Imitable Difficulty (MID) and Difficulty-Stratified Joint Error (DSJE), providing fresh insights into imitation learning."

    "abstract": "In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function."

The main objective is to identify the critical plots for intervention, using the network connectivity and potential intervention constraints. Using results from monotone systems theory, we first derive a sufficient condition guaranteeing the elimination of the wild population through SIT, which relies on the sign of the Perron value of a certain Metzler matrix. When an Allee effect is naturally present, releases are finite in time, and an upper bound of the control time is provided. We then formulate an optimisation problem aimed at minimising the total daily number of sterile insects released to ensure population elimination. We focus in particular on the oriental fruit fly, which significantly impacts mango orchards in La Réunion. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate our theoretical results and study different scenarios, including some where releases are limited to certain orchards. Indeed, when implementing SIT in the field, some owners may be reluctant to allow releases on their property. We also consider additional control by mass trapping, which can affect the sterile insects entering trapped areas, and show that although it increases the critical number of sterile insects to be released daily, it reduces the duration of the SIT program. Mass trapping may thus decrease the total number of sterile insects released over the entire elimination program."

While recent work explores multimodal representations for behavior retrieval in the General Search Unit (GSU), they often neglect multimodal integration in the fine-grained modeling stage -- the Exact Search Unit (ESU). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of how to effectively leverage multimodal signals across both stages of the two-stage lifelong modeling framework. Our key insight is that simplicity suffices in the GSU: lightweight cosine similarity with high-quality multimodal embeddings outperforms complex retrieval mechanisms. In contrast, the ESU demands richer multimodal sequence modeling and effective ID-multimodal fusion to unlock its full potential. Guided by these principles, we propose MUSE, a simple yet effective multimodal search-based framework. MUSE has been deployed in Taobao display advertising system, enabling 100K-length user behavior sequence modeling and delivering significant gains in top-line metrics with negligible online latency overhead. To foster community research, we share industrial deployment practices and open-source the first large-scale dataset featuring ultra-long behavior sequences paired with high-quality multimodal embeddings.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning with diffusion models has advanced robotic control by capturing multi-modal action distributions. However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies."

    "abstract": "In bus arrival time prediction, the process of organizing road infrastructure network data into homogeneous entities is known as segmentation. Segmenting a road network is widely recognized as the first and most critical step in developing an arrival time prediction system, particularly for auto-regressive-based approaches. Traditional methods typically employ a uniform segmentation strategy, which fails to account for varying physical constraints along roads, such as road conditions, intersections, and points of interest, thereby limiting prediction efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to efficiently and adaptively learn non-uniform road segments for arrival time prediction. Our method decouples the prediction process into two stages: 1) Non-uniform road segments are extracted based on their impact scores using the proposed RL framework; and 2) A linear prediction model is applied to the selected segments to make predictions. This method ensures optimal segment selection while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a significant improvement over traditional uniform approaches. Furthermore, our experimental results suggest that the linear approach can even achieve better performance than more complex methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which not only enhances efficiency but also improves learning performance on large-scale benchmarks.

These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xiujiesong/StorytellingImageGeneration."

Our findings reveal that these trained classifiers in DPDAtt depend significantly on superficial syntactic features, leading to substantial misclassification when such cues are removed through obfuscation.

    "abstract": "Chart understanding is crucial for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios such as analyzing scientific papers and technical reports. Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

To resolve this theoretical puzzle, we reconceptualized the role of FC through an empirical study of 470 Indonesian university students. Our robust, multi-stage analytical approach first confirmed the significant influence of established drivers--Performance Expectancy (beta=0.190), Effort Expectancy (beta=0.198), Social Influence (beta=0.151), and Perceived Enjoyment (beta=0.472)--on Behavioral Intention (BI), which in turn strongly predicted Use Behavior (beta=0.666). Crucially, however, the direct effect of FC on BI proved non-significant (beta=-0.085). A subsequent mediation model revealed FC's true function as a foundational enabling construct that operates indirectly by powerfully enhancing both Performance Expectancy (beta=0.556) and Effort Expectancy (beta=0.419). Our findings demonstrate that the value of technological infrastructure lies not in its mere presence, but in its dynamic capacity to enable learning and optimize user experience. This research advances a refined \"enabling pathway\" theoretical framework, guiding administrators to shift the focus of technological investment from merely providing tools to strategically crafting learning experiences."

This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition. Third, the model's stability and practicality are validated through delicate experimental design, enhancing its applicability in real-world product environments. This provides a crucial theoretical and technical foundation for the practical implementation of next-generation ITS."

The basic principle is to iteratively refine the model with real samples and synthetic ones generated from itself. However, the existing methods primarily focus on the relative gaps between the rewards for two types of data, neglecting their absolute values. Through theoretical analysis, we identify that the gap-based methods suffer from unstable evolution, due to the potentially degenerated objectives. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel self-play fine-tuning method, namely Self-PlAy via Noise Contrastive Estimation (SPACE), which leverages noise contrastive estimation to capture the real-world data distribution. Specifically, SPACE treats synthetic samples as auxiliary components, and discriminates them from the real ones in a binary classification manner. As a result, SPACE independently optimizes the absolute reward values for each type of data, ensuring a consistently meaningful objective and thereby avoiding the instability issue. Theoretically, we show that the optimal solution of the objective in SPACE aligns with the underlying distribution of real-world data, and SPACE guarantees a provably stable convergence to the optimal distribution. Empirically, we show that SPACE significantly improves the performance of LLMs over various tasks, and outperforms supervised fine-tuning that employs much more real-world samples. Compared to gap-based self-play fine-tuning methods, SPACE exhibits remarkable superiority and stable evolution."

    "abstract": "Image fusion aims to blend complementary information from multiple sensing modalities, yet existing approaches remain limited in robustness, adaptability, and controllability. Most current fusion networks are tailored to specific tasks and lack the ability to flexibly incorporate user intent, especially in complex scenarios involving low-light degradation, color shifts, or exposure imbalance. Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities. DiTFuse unifies infrared-visible, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion-as well as text-controlled refinement and downstream tasks-within a single architecture. Experiments on public IVIF, MFF, and MEF benchmarks confirm superior quantitative and qualitative performance, sharper textures, and better semantic retention. The model also supports multi-level user control and zero-shot generalization to other multi-image fusion scenarios, including instruction-conditioned segmentation."

We demonstrate that near-field electric (NFE) communication breaks this trade-off via capacitive coupling enabled by confined electric fields. NFE simultaneously achieves ultra-low power ($<$1 mW per transceiver), high-speed data throughput ($>$3 Mbps), and configurable decimeter-range (5-30 cm) capabilities previously considered mutually exclusive. Systematic measurements across multiple orientations and configurations show NFE can support decimeter communication coverage. The power consumption of 0.4 mW at the transmitter (Tx) and 0.6 mW at the receiver (Rx), when combined is up to $\\sim$24$\\times$ lower than NFC and $\\sim$3$\\times$ lower than NFMI while achieving significantly higher data rates, and a couple of orders of magnitude lower power than mm-wave based technique. Testing with symmetrical electrodes across eight orientations validated consistent performance and robustness for practical deployments. Extended-range experiments achieved stable 2 Mbps throughput at 3.5 meters using conductive media, demonstrating NFE's unique ability to leverage environmental conductors. Optimized device design can facilitate achieving an extended range for Body-assisted NFE up to 1 m.

Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities."

To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing.

    "abstract": "In this paper we give a gauge theoretic construction of the joint moduli space of stable G-Higgs bundles on closed Riemann surfaces, where the Riemann surface structure is allowed to vary in the Teichmüller space of the underlying smooth surface. This joint moduli space has many interesting structures that are preserved by the mapping class group of the surface. We describe a surprising relationship between four key objects: the isomonodromic foliation, a canonical hermitian form arising from the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic structure on the character variety, a canonical holomorphic form which vertically lifts vector fields on Teichmüller space, and the energy function for equivariant harmonic maps. One consequence of this work is the construction of pseudo-Kähler metrics on many examples of components of character varieties which include rank two higher Teichmüller spaces. This recovers some of the recent work on the subject by various authors."

    "abstract": "The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is investigated in hematite, a collinear antiferromagnetic insulator, across a broad wavelength spectrum. By combining the optical measurements with magnetometry results, we unambiguously demonstrate that the Néel-order contribution dominates the MOKE signal, while contributions from net magnetization and external magnetic fields are negligible. This conclusion is quantitatively supported by first-principles calculations, and qualitatively by a symmetry analysis that the Néel contribution appears at the first order in spin-orbit coupling while the magnetization contribution starts only at the third order. This study clarifies the altermagnetic origin of the pronounced MOKE in hematite, underscoring the potential of altermagnets as a promising new class of magneto-optical materials."

    "abstract": "Generative AI(GenAI) is a kind of AI model capable of producing human-like content in various modalities, including text, image, audio, video, and computer programming. Although GenAI offers great potential for education, its value often depends on students' ability to engage with it actively, responsibly, and critically - qualities central to student agency. Nevertheless, student agency has long been a complex and ambiguous concept in educational discourses, with few empirical studies clarifying its distinct nature and process in AI-assisted learning environments. To address this gap, the qualitative study presented in this article examines how higher education students exercise agency in AI-assisted learning and proposes a theoretical framework using a grounded theory approach. Guided by agentic engagement theory, this article analyzes the authentic experiences of 26 students using data from their GenAI conversation records and cognitive interviews that capture their thought processes and decision-making. The findings identify four key aspects of student agency: initiating and (re)directing, mindful adoption, external help-seeking, and reflective learning. Together, these aspects form an empirically developed framework that characterizes student agency in AI-assisted learning as a proactive, intentional, adaptive, reflective, and iterative process. Based on the empirical findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed for researchers, educators, and policymakers."

    "abstract": "Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been extensively employed for network security. It examines traffic payloads by searching for regular expressions (regex) with the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) model. However, as the network bandwidth and ruleset size are increasing rapidly, the conventional DFA model has emerged as a significant performance bottleneck of DPI. Leveraging the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) instruction to perform state transitions can substantially boost the efficiency of the DFA model. In this paper, we propose Hyperflex, a novel SIMD-based DFA model designed for high-performance regex matching. Hyperflex incorporates a region detection algorithm to identify regions suitable for acceleration by SIMD instructions across the whole DFA graph. Also, we design a hybrid state transition algorithm that enables state transition in both SIMD-accelerated and normal regions, and ensures seamless state transition across the two types of regions. We have implemented Hyperflex on the commodity CPU and evaluated it with real network traffic and DPI regexes. Our evaluation results indicate that Hyperflex reaches a throughput of 8.89Gbit/s, representing an improvement of up to 2.27 times over Mcclellan, the default DFA model of the prominent multi-pattern regex matching engine Hyperscan. As a result, Hyperflex has been successfully deployed in Hyperscan, significantly enhancing its performance."

Our article empirically assesses these online versus offline dynamics by linking a novel dataset of voters' offline partisan segregation extracted from publicly available voter files for 180 million US voters with their online network segregation on Twitter. We investigate offline and online partisan segregation using measures of geographical and network isolation of every matched voter-twitter user to their co-partisans online and offline. Our results show that while social media users tend to form politically homogeneous online networks, these levels of partisan sorting are significantly lower than those found in offline settings. Notably, Democrats are more isolated than Republicans in both settings, and only older Republicans exhibit higher online than offline segregation. Our results contribute to the emerging literature on political communication and the homophily of online networks, providing novel evidence on partisan sorting both online and offline."

    "abstract": "Molecular computation in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) now constitutes a foundational framework for designing programmable biological systems. However, prevailing design methodologies primarily treat parallelism of chemical reactions as a liability, consequently motivating researchers to redirect research focus toward leveraging parallelism to implement layer-by-layer computations of composite functions in coupled mass-action systems (MASs). MASs exhibiting this property are termed composable. Present composability verification for MASs mainly depends on input-to-state stability (ISS) conditions, with structural characteristics of networks remaining underexplored. This paper investigates the structural conditions under which two MASs are composable. By leveraging ISS-Lyapunov functions, we identify a class of CRN architectures, whose reduced systems have zero deficiency, that guarantee composability with other networks. We also extend our conclusions to encompass some CRN architectures possessing nonzero deficiency. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results. Finally, we employ our methods to devise an algorithm for constructing MASs capable of executing specified molecular computations."

    "abstract": "Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate."

In this work, we introduce Token Filtering, a lightweight online structured pruning technique that makes pruning decisions directly during inference without any calibration data. The key idea is to measure token redundancy via joint key-value similarity and skip redundant attention computations, thereby reducing inference cost while preserving critical information. To further enhance stability, we design a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively weights key and value similarity across heads, ensuring that informative tokens are retained even under high pruning ratios. This design introduces no additional memory overhead and provides a more reliable criterion for token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-2 (7B/13B), LLaMA-3 (8B), and Mistral (7B) demonstrate that Token Filtering consistently outperforms prior structured pruning methods, preserving accuracy on commonsense reasoning benchmarks and maintaining strong performance on challenging tasks such as MMLU, even with 50% pruning."

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) plays a central role in molecular representation learning. Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs."

Here, we present a multiparametric framework combining fractal and multifractal analysis and their distributions to quantify structural alterations in human brain tissue affected by AD. Moreover, from the fractal and multifractal formalism, we introduced an innovative fractal functional distribution method, a novel technique that transforms fractal distribution into a Gaussian form. Statistically, these distribution parameters are easy to interpret and can distinguish between control and diseased tissues. Across samples, we identify pronounced threshold-dependent behavior of fractal and multifractal parameters, reflecting the intrinsic sparsity and heterogeneous intensity landscape of brain tissue. These threshold-sensitive signatures provide a framework for quantitative stage detection and may serve as biomarkers for early pathological transitions. In addition, we studied structural disorder and complexity using our established light localization technique, inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis. IPR-based analysis demonstrates that increasing IPR pixel size highlights the elevation of structural alterations with disease progression. Together, these integrative analyses establish a robust, multi-scale quantitative framework for detecting microstructural alterations in AD, providing a promising foundation for early diagnosis and improved pathological assessment."

Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing."

To date, spatially resolved imaging exists for well over a hundred debris disc systems. Simple analytical radiative transfer models of debris dust emission can reveal trends in disc properties as a function of their host stars' luminosities. Here we present such an analysis for 133 debris discs, calculating the dust grain minimum sizes ($s_{\\rm min}$), dust masses ($M_{\\rm dust}$), and exponents of the size distribution ($q$) in conjunction with their architectures determined at far-infrared or millimetre wavelengths. The distribution of $q$ at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths is characterised for the first time, finding a value of $3.49^{+0.38}_{-0.33}$. We further newly identify a trend between $q$ and $R_{\\rm disc}$, which may be indicative of velocity dependent fragmentation, or grain growth at large radii. We find the disc masses inferred from this analysis are consistent with those of protoplanetary discs. Finally, we identify samples of debris discs suitable for further characterisation at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths, expanding the number of spatially resolved systems upon which future studies of these statistics can be based."

Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits.

This flexible class of financial market models allows for features such as reflecting boundaries, skewness effects, sticky points, and slowdowns on fractal sets. For this market model, we study the structure of a strong form of arbitrage opportunity called increasing profits. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the existence of increasing profits in terms of an auxiliary deterministic signed measure $ν$ and a canonical trading strategy $θ$, both of which depend only on the deterministic parametric characteristics of our model, namely the scale function, the speed measure, and the interest rate. More precisely, we show that an increasing profit exists if and only if $ν$ is nontrivial, and that this is equivalent to $θ$ itself generating an increasing profit. Second, we provide a precise characterization of the entire set of increasing profits in terms of $ν$ and $θ$, and moreover characterize the value processes associated with increasing profits. Finally, we establish novel connections between no-arbitrage theory and the general theory of stochastic processes. Specifically, we relate the failure of the representation property for general diffusions to the existence of certain types of increasing profits whose value processes are dominated by the quadratic variation measure of a space-transformed version of the asset price process."

Rather than assuming access to the exact nominal transition kernel, we consider the realistic setting where only samples from multiple system executions are available. These samples may correspond to different transition models inside an ambiguity set around the nominal transition kernel. Using these observations, we construct a unified ambiguity set that captures both inherent run-to-run variability in the transition dynamics and finite-sample statistical uncertainty. This ambiguity set is formalized through a Wasserstein-distance ball around a nominal empirical distribution and naturally induces an interval Markov decision process representation of the underlying system. Within this representation, we introduce a robust safety function that characterizes reach-avoid type probabilistic safety under all transition kernels consistent with the interval Markov decision process. We further derive high-confidence safety guarantees for the true, unknown time-varying system. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach."

While we show their existence is independent from ZFC, under basic set theoretic assumptions, we produce a plethora of these states. Finally, we find an irreducible representation of the Calkin algebra which fails infinite transitivity."

Built on experiments by one of us based on a simple parallel plate model for inertial sensor, in the present work a more sophisticated inertial sensor model that mimics the surface properties and work function of a cubical TM of an inertial sensor in space (like that of the LISA Pathfinder) is employed to study bipolar charge management system that utilizes UV-LEDs with peak wavelengths of 269 nm, 275 nm, 280 nm, and 295 nm that are longer than the standard 255 nm commonly employed for direct TM illumination. Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies. The present work provides useful input in the future study of system design and optimization for the charge management system."

Standard implementations, however, utilize only the real component of the complex-valued dot product for attention score calculation. This simplification discards the imaginary component, which contains valuable phase information, leading to a potential loss of relational details crucial for modeling long-context dependencies. In this paper, we propose an extension that re-incorporates this discarded imaginary component. Our method leverages the full complex-valued representation to create a dual-component attention score. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that this approach enhances the modeling of long-context dependencies by preserving more positional information. Furthermore, evaluations on a suite of long-context language modeling benchmarks show that our method consistently improves performance over the standard RoPE, with the benefits becoming more significant as context length increases.

In this work, we present aLEAKator, an open-source framework for the automated formal verification of masked cryptographic accelerators and software running on CPUs from their HDL descriptions. Our method introduces mixed-domain simulation, enabling precise modeling and verification under various (including robust and relaxed) 1-probing leakage models, and supports variable signal granularity without being restricted to 1-bit wires. aLEAKator also supports verification in the presence of lookup tables, and does not require prior knowledge of the target CPU architecture.

The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers. When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of \"simplicity\" known as \"Ockham's razor\" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that \"we learn some things only by doing things\". The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning."

    "abstract": "Circularly polarized or axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum have attracted considerable interest. These phonons have finite magnetic moment and can couple to internal magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons. We have also performed ab initio calculations on representative materials to validate the proposed magneto-alteraxial phonon spectra and PAM patterns. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials."

To address this critical limitation, we introduce MeshRipple, which expands a mesh outward from an active generation frontier, akin to a ripple on a surface.MeshRipple rests on three key innovations: a frontier-aware BFS tokenization that aligns the generation order with surface topology; an expansive prediction strategy that maintains coherent, connected surface growth; and a sparse-attention global memory that provides an effectively unbounded receptive field to resolve long-range topological dependencies.This integrated design enables MeshRipple to generate meshes with high surface fidelity and topological completeness, outperforming strong recent baselines."

This combines a standard formulation of bidirectional typechecking with Zeilberger's `cocontextual' variant. We extend this to ordinary `cartesian' System L using Mc Bride's co-de Bruijn formulation of scopes, and show that both can be combined in a linear-nonlinear style, where linear types are positive and cartesian types are negative.

    "abstract": "Understanding how microscopic interactions control macroscopic phase transitions is central to quantum materials, where charge density waves (CDWs), Mott states, and superconductivity often compete. In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium."

Motivated by both open-loop and adaptive neurostimulation protocols, we study two practically relevant input structures: periodic (repetitive) charge-balanced inputs and non-repetitive charge-balanced inputs.

In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code. It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations. Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\\% success rate of the SOTA approach."

    "abstract": "Ensuring the authenticity of video content remains challenging as DeepFake generation becomes increasingly realistic and robust against detection. Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections."

    "abstract": "On-device machine learning (ML) introduces new security concerns about model privacy. Storing valuable trained ML models on user devices exposes them to potential extraction by adversaries. The current mainstream solution for on-device model protection is storing the weights and conducting inference within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, due to limited trusted memory that cannot accommodate the whole model, most existing approaches employ a partitioning strategy, dividing a model into multiple slices that are loaded into the TEE sequentially. This frequent interaction between untrusted and trusted worlds dramatically increases inference latency, sometimes by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we propose Amulet, a fast TEE-shielded on-device inference framework for ML model protection. Amulet incorporates a suite of obfuscation methods specifically designed for common neural network architectures. After obfuscation by the TEE, the entire transformed model can be securely stored in untrusted memory, allowing the inference process to execute directly in untrusted memory with GPU acceleration. For each inference request, only two rounds of minimal-overhead interaction between untrusted and trusted memory are required to process input samples and output results. We also provide theoretical proof from an information-theoretic perspective that the obfuscated model does not leak information about the original weights. We comprehensively evaluated Amulet using diverse model architectures ranging from ResNet-18 to GPT-2. Our approach incurs inference latency only 2.8-4.8x that of unprotected models with negligible accuracy loss, achieving an 8-9x speedup over baseline methods that execute inference entirely within TEEs, and performing approximately 2.2x faster than the state-of-the-art obfuscation-based method."

Yet, emerging and disruptive technologies are reshaping the landscape of nuclear risks, presenting a critical juncture for decision makers. This article lays out the contours of an overlooked but intensifying technological arms race for nuclear (in)visibility, driven by the interplay between proliferation-enabling technologies (PETs) and detection-enhancing technologies (DETs). We argue that the strategic pattern of proliferation will be increasingly shaped by the innovation pace in these domains. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces unprecedented complexity to this equation, as its rapid scaling and knowledge substitution capabilities accelerate PET development and challenge traditional monitoring and verification methods. To analyze this dynamic, we develop a formal model centered on a Relative Advantage Index (RAI), quantifying the shifting balance between PETs and DETs. Our model explores how asymmetric technological advancement, particularly logistic AI-driven PET growth versus stepwise DET improvements, expands the band of uncertainty surrounding proliferation detectability. Through replicable scenario-based simulations, we evaluate the impact of varying PET growth rates and DET investment strategies on cumulative nuclear breakout risk. We identify a strategic fork ahead, where detection may no longer suffice without broader PET governance. Governments and international organizations should accordingly invest in policies and tools agile enough to keep pace with tomorrow's technology."

    "abstract": "The reliable operation of autonomous vehicles, automated driving functions, and advanced driver assistance systems across a wide range of relevant scenarios is critical for their development and deployment. Identifying a near-complete set of relevant driving scenarios for such functionalities is challenging due to numerous degrees of freedom involved, each affecting the outcomes of the driving scenario differently. Moreover, with increasing technical complexity of new functionalities, the number of potentially relevant, particularly \"unknown unsafe\" scenarios is increasing. To enhance validation efficiency, it is essential to identify relevant scenarios in advance, starting with simpler domains like highways before moving to more complex environments such as urban traffic. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing lane change scenarios in highway traffic, which involve multiple degrees of freedom and present numerous safetyrelevant scenarios. We describe the process of data acquisition and processing of real-world data from public highway traffic, followed by the application of criticality measures on trajectory data to evaluate scenarios, as conducted within the AVEAS project (www.aveas.org). By linking the calculated measures to specific lane change driving scenarios and the conditions under which the data was collected, we facilitate the identification of safetyrelevant driving scenarios for various applications. Further, to tackle the extensive range of \"unknown unsafe\" scenarios, we propose a way to generate relevant scenarios by creating synthetic scenarios based on recorded ones. Consequently, we demonstrate and evaluate a processing chain that enables the identification of safety-relevant scenarios, the development of data-driven methods for extracting these scenarios, and the generation of synthetic critical scenarios via sampling on highways."

We develop an abstract optimal recovery framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) for reconstructing unknown target functions from mixed equality and inequality functional constraints. Within this framework, the approximation of $v^*$ is cast as a collocation-type problem derived from verification conditions for optimality -- most prominently, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation -- that uniquely characterizes $v^*$. As the set of collocation points becomes dense in the ambient domain $Ω$, we establish convergence of the RKHS approximants to $v^*$: globally on $Ω$ in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is analytic, and locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is bounded from above and below by quadratic functions. Furthermore, we show that a practical numerical realization of the abstract scheme reduces to the classical policy iteration algorithm. Numerical experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that spinning wormholes may mimic Kerr black holes in astronomical sources such as X-ray binaries and supermassive compact objects in centers of galaxies. With recent advances in instrumentation this could be tested if clear differences between wormhole and black hole accretion were identified. We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference.

The presence of photons in the resonator triggers the frequency conversion of photons. The scattering spectra and the conversion contrast are studied in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The disappearance of frequency conversion is rooted in the complete suppression of the emission from the excited state to either of lower states in the $n+1$ subspace where $n$ is the photon number of the resonator, and the non-Markovicity-induced nonreciprocity is found under specific conditions. Altering the photon number $n$ induces the non-reciprocal transmission of single photons in the waveguide, hence, enhance the conversion probability."

However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency."

In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware, fault-resilient DNN partitioning framework targeting multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II, where accuracy degradation under fault conditions is introduced as a core metric alongside energy and latency. Our framework performs runtime fault injection during optimization and utilizes a feedback loop to prioritize fault-tolerant partitioning. We evaluate our approach on benchmark CNNs including AlexNet, SqueezeNet and ResNet18 on hardware accelerators, and demonstrate up to 27.7% improvement in fault tolerance with minimal increase in performance overhead. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating resilience into DNN partitioning, and thereby paving the way for robust AI inference in error-prone environments."

Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel MSA framework designed for domain generalization. Firstly, the framework incorporates a Mixture of Invariant Experts model to extract domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to learn synergistic relationships between modalities. Secondly, we design a Cross-Modal Adapter to augment the semantic richness of multimodal representations through cross-modal knowledge injection.

Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment."

In particular, it is crucial to capture the influence that the presence of an individual can have on the others. Important examples of applications include crowd simulation and emergency management, where the simulation of the mass of people passes through the simulation of the individuals, taking into consideration the others as part of the general context. While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models. We instantiate the general methodology on two real case studies, one on cars and one on pedestrians, and a full experimental evaluation is performed, both in terms of performances, parameter sensitivity and interpretation of sample results."

Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro.

    "abstract": "Microplastics are transported by ocean surface waves in ways that depart significantly from the Stokes drift of fluid parcels, and accurate modeling of this transport requires accounting for forces beyond linear drag. Existing modeling of microplastic transport often neglect the Basset-Boussinesq history force, effectively limiting their use to the smallest particle sizes. Here, we extend the applicability of these models by implementing the history term with a multistep integration scheme, allowing us to capture the transport of larger microplastics in linear surface waves of arbitrary depth. We quantify when the Basset-Boussinesq history force significantly affects microplastic transport by surface gravity waves. We show that memory effects become the leading-order horizontal drag once $S=St/γ^2$ exceeds a critical value $S\\approx 0.25$, where $St$ is the Stokes number and $γ$ is the density ratio of the particle and the fluid. The corresponding critical $St$ number is found to be a factor of about three smaller than that given by classical inertial estimates that neglect history effects. These results help provide regime maps that can be used to indicate when history effects can be safely neglected. Our simulations also reveal that history effects significantly increase horizontal transport distances and enhance orbit shearing of particle ensembles."

We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay."

To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, requiring only the model's forward pass. This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method. Comprehensive evaluations across four baselines, five TTA methods, and two realistic scenarios with three model architecture demonstrate that SICL reduces calibration error by an average of 13 percentage points compared to conventional calibration approaches."

Current approaches for detecting small objects in aerial images often involve image cropping and modifications to detector network architectures. Techniques such as sliding window cropping and architectural enhancements, including higher-resolution feature maps and attention mechanisms, are commonly employed. Given the growing importance of aerial imagery in various critical and industrial applications, the need for robust frameworks for small object detection becomes imperative. To address this need, we adopted the base SW-YOLO approach to enhance speed and accuracy in small object detection by refining cropping dimensions and overlap in sliding window usage and subsequently enhanced it through architectural modifications. we propose a novel model by modifying the base model architecture, including advanced feature extraction modules in the neck for feature map enhancement, integrating CBAM in the backbone to preserve spatial and channel information, and introducing a new head to boost small object detection accuracy. Finally, we compared our method with SAHI, one of the most powerful frameworks for processing large-scale images, and CZDet, which is also based on image cropping, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. The proposed model achieves significant accuracy gains on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming baseline YOLOv5L detection by a substantial margin. Specifically, the final proposed model elevates the mAP .5.5 accuracy on the VisDrone2019 dataset from the base accuracy of 35.5 achieved by the YOLOv5L detector to 61.2.

System latency and object misalignment can disrupt communication, reduce task efficiency, and negatively impact the overall user experience. While previous research has primarily focused on individual AR interactions, the impact of these inconsistencies on collaboration remains underexplored. This article investigates how user experience and task load are affected by object misalignment and time delay in a shared AR space. To examine these factors, we conducted an experiment with 32 participants, organized into 16 pairs, who collaboratively completed a spatial placement task. Within each condition, both participants alternated roles, taking turns as the leader-providing verbal placement instructions-and the builder-executing the placement. Six conditions were tested, manipulating object alignment (perfectly aligned vs. randomly misaligned) and time delay (0s, 0.1s, 0.4s). The misalignment was applied randomly to each virtual object with a shift of +-20 cm on every axis to create a clear distinction in spatial perception. User experience and task load were assessed to evaluate how these factors influence collaboration and interaction in AR environments. Results showed that spatial misalignment significantly increased perceived workload (NASA-TLX) and lowered user ratings in Pragmatic quality and Attractiveness (UEQ), while time delay had a more limited effect. These findings highlight the critical role of spatial accuracy in maintaining collaboration quality in AR."

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Human hand simulation plays a critical role in digital twin applications, requiring models that balance anatomical fidelity with computational efficiency. We present a complete pipeline for constructing multi-rigid-body approximations of human hands that preserve realistic appearance while enabling real-time physics simulation. Starting from optical motion capture of a specific human hand, we construct a personalized MANO (Multi-Abstracted hand model with Neural Operations) model and convert it to a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) representation with anatomically consistent joint axes. The key technical challenge is projecting MANO's unconstrained SO(3) joint rotations onto the kinematically constrained joints of the rigid-body model. We derive closed-form solutions for single degree-of-freedom joints and introduce a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-corrected iterative method for two degree-of-freedom joints that properly handles the non-commutativity of rotations. We validate our approach through digital twin experiments where reinforcement learning policies control the multi-rigid-body hand to replay captured human demonstrations. Quantitative evaluation shows sub-centimeter reconstruction error and successful grasp execution across diverse manipulation tasks."

This research investigates user experience and preferences when interacting with a healthcare application utilizing virtual avatars displayed in different sizes. For our study, we had 23 participants interacting with five different avatars (a human-size avatar followed by four smaller avatars in a randomized order) varying in size, projected on a wall in front of them. The avatars were fully integrated with an artificial intelligence chatbot to make them conversational. Users were asked to rate the usability of the system after interacting with each avatar and complete a survey regarding trust and an additional questionnaire on social presence. The results of this study show that avatar size significantly influences the perceived attractiveness and perspicuity, with the medium-sized avatars receiving the highest ratings. Social presence correlated strongly with stimulation and attractiveness, suggesting that an avatar's visual appeal and interactivity influenced user engagement more than its physical size. Additionally, we observed a tendency for gender-specific differences on some of the UEQ+ scales, with male participants tending to prefer human-sized representations, while female participants slightly favored smaller avatars. These findings highlight the importance of avatar design and representation in optimizing user experience and trust in virtual healthcare environments."

Compared to large language models (LLMs) processing 1D sequences, their memory consumption scales cubically, necessitating parallel serving across multiple GPUs. Traditional parallelism strategies partition the computational graph, requiring frequent high-dimensional activation transfers that create severe communication bottlenecks. To tackle this issue, we exploit the local spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the diffusion denoising process and propose Latent Parallelism (LP), the first parallelism strategy tailored for VDM serving. \\textcolor{black}{LP decomposes the global denoising problem into parallelizable sub-problems by dynamically rotating the partitioning dimensions (temporal, height, and width) within the compact latent space across diffusion timesteps, substantially reducing the communication overhead compared to prevailing parallelism strategies.} To ensure generation quality, we design a patch-aligned overlapping partition strategy that matches partition boundaries with visual patches and a position-aware latent reconstruction mechanism for smooth stitching. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that LP reduces communication overhead by up to 97\\% over baseline methods while maintaining comparable generation quality. As a non-intrusive plug-in paradigm, LP can be seamlessly integrated with existing parallelism strategies, enabling efficient and scalable video generation services."

Here we provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite does in fact host photoluminescent color centres. In meteoritic lonsdaleite grains from the ureilite NWA7983, we identify a new defect, RU1, which exhibits bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm, with optimal blue excitation (~455 nm) and a peak at ~700 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns with no detectable blinking, bleaching, or charge conversion. From the excitation-emission energetics we infer an unresolved zero-phonon line near 550 nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirms the lonsdaleite host lattice, and compositional analysis suggests N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents. These results suggest lonsdaleite could become a new quantum-grade crystalline platform and indicate that hexagonal-diamond color centres may form a new and unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters."

The robot employs a single rolled dielectric elastomer actuator, while groove patterns on a 3D-printed substrate guide its alignment and trajectory. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that varying groove angles enables precise control of locomotion direction without the need for complex actuation strategies. This groove-guided approach reduces energy consumption, simplifies robot design, and expands the applicability of bio-inspired soft robots in fields such as search and rescue, pipe inspection, and planetary exploration."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, RLVR often leads to entropy collapse, resulting in premature policy convergence and performance saturation. While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance."

One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code correctness. Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code."

    "abstract": "Interactive tours help users explore datasets and provide onboarding. They rely on a linear sequence of views, showing a curated set of relevant data selections and introduce user interfaces. Existing frameworks of tours, however, often do not allow for branching and refining hypotheses outside of a rigid sequence, which is important in knowledge-centric domains such as law. For example, lawyers performing analytical case analysis need to iteratively weigh up different legal norms and construct strings of arguments. To address this gap, we propose SemanticTours, a semantic, graph-based model of tours that shifts from a sequence-based towards a graph-based navigation. Our model constructs a domain-specific knowledge graph that connects data elements based on user-definable semantic relationships. These relationships enable non-linear graph navigation that defines tours. We apply SemanticTours to the domain of law and conceptualize a visual analytics design and interaction concept for analytical reasoning in legal case analysis. Our concept accounts for the inherent complexity of graph-based tours using aggregated graph nodes and supporting navigation with a semantic lens. During an evaluation with six domain experts from law, they suggest that graph-based tours better support their analytical reasoning than sequences. Our work opens research opportunities for such tours to support analytical reasoning in law and other knowledge-centric domains."

However, in the large majority of these applications, model checking is only used at the very end, when no counterexample can be found anymore for the latest hypothesis model. This contrasts with the original proposal of black-box checking (BBC) by Peled, Vardi & Yannakakis, which applies model checking for all hypotheses, also the intermediate ones. In this article, we present the first systematic evaluation of the ability of BBC to find bugs quickly, based on 77 benchmarks models from real protocol implementations and controllers for which specifications of safety properties are available. Our main finding are: (a) In cases where the full model can be learned, BBC detects violations of the specifications with just 3.4% of the queries needed by an approach in which model checking is only used for the full model. (b) Even when the full model cannot be learned, BBC is still able to detect many violations of the specification. In particular, BBC manages to detect 94% of the safety properties violations in the challenging RERS 2019 industrial LTL benchmarks. (c) Our results also confirm that BBC is way more effective than existing MBT algorithms in finding deep bugs in implementations."

This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkable photorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a core diffusion model of only 6B parameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or larger Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimal VRAM usage and rapid inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels in image editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensive open-source ecosystem to date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions for text-to-image and image editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain of training procedure. We believe that the openness of LongCat-Image will provide robust support for developers and researchers, pushing the frontiers of visual content creation."

Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\\mathbf{q},ω)$, computed from low-scaling \\textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $γ$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\\approx1.73$ eV) and $γ$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate."

We find that the resulting steady-states fall into two distinct classes: (i) NESSs with persistent probability currents, and (ii) current-free non-Gibbs steady states characterized by a frequency-dependent effective inverse temperature. We demonstrate, using a three-level system, that NESSs with probability current can function as noisy stochastic clock, while current-free non-Gibbs steady states possess non-zero non-equilibrium free energy, indicating their potential as a quantum battery for work extraction or storage."

Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals."

The proof combines the high temperature expansion, random-cluster and random current representations. A new input in the proof is that, in the near-critical sourceless single current measure, there are many loops formed by a path on $a\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with diameter of order $1$, together with two external edges that connect the path's endpoints to the ghost."

    "abstract": "In pre-market drug safety review, grouping related adverse event terms into SMQs or OCMQs is critical for signal detection. We assess the performance of SafeTerm Automated Medical Query (AMQ) on MedDRA SMQs. The AMQ is a novel quantitative artificial intelligence system that understands and processes medical terminology and automatically retrieves relevant MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) for a given input query, ranking them by a relevance score (0-1) using multi-criteria statistical methods. The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity, and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against tier-1 SMQs (110 queries, v28.1). Precision, recall and F1 were computed at multiple similarity-thresholds, defined either manually or using an automated method. High recall (94%)) is achieved at moderate similarity thresholds, indicative of good retrieval sensitivity. Higher thresholds filter out more terms, resulting in improved precision (up to 89%). The optimal threshold (0.70)) yielded an overall recall of (48%) and precision of (45%) across all 110 queries. Restricting to narrow-term PTs achieved slightly better performance at an increased (+0.05) similarity threshold, confirming increased relatedness of narrow versus broad terms. The automatic threshold (0.66) selection prioritizes recall (0.58) to precision (0.29). SafeTerm AMQ achieves comparable, satisfactory performance on SMQs and sanitized OCMQs. It is therefore a viable supplementary method for automated MedDRA query generation, balancing recall and precision. We recommend using suitable MedDRA PT terminology in query formulation and applying the automated threshold method to optimise recall. Increasing similarity scores allows refined, narrow terms selection."

In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware network topology optimization framework to maximize consensus speed under edge cardinality constraints. For heterogeneous bandwidth scenarios, we introduce a maximum bandwidth allocation strategy for the edges to ensure efficient communication among nodes. By reformulating the problem into an equivalent Mixed-Integer SDP problem, we leverage a computationally efficient ADMM-based method to obtain topologies that yield the maximum consensus speed. Within the ADMM substep, we adopt the conjugate gradient method to efficiently solve large-scale linear equations to achieve better scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting network topologies outperform the benchmark topologies in terms of consensus speed, and reduce the training time required for decentralized learning tasks on real-world datasets to achieve the target test accuracy, exhibiting speedups of more than $1.11\\times$ and $1.21\\times$ for homogeneous and heterogeneous bandwidth settings, respectively."

To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\\approx 5 \\%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides."

    "abstract": "In observational studies of dietary exposures, the energy adjustment strategy has a critical impact on the effect being estimated. Adjusting for total energy intake or expressing the exposure as a percentage of total energy, leads to a substitution effect being estimated. This impacts the interpretation of primary studies and meta-analyses. Unless energy adjustment strategies are considered, meta-analyses may end up pooling estimates for incomparable effects. This meta-scientific review aimed to investigate the extent to which meta-analyses of dietary exposures may be pooling incomparable effects by reviewing the energy adjustment strategies. We identified all meta-analyses examining the relationship between saturated fat and fish and cardiovascular disease. The two most recent and two most cited reviews for each exposure were examined, along with all primary studies. Information on the study aims, targeted effects, and interpretations were summarized. The eight meta-analyses summarised results from 82 primary studies including 144 unique models. Only one meta-analysis explicitly considered the energy adjustment strategy of the primary studies to determine eligibility for a substitution subgroup analysis. None of the meta-analyses acknowledged that they were pooling estimates for different effects. 82% of the models from the primary studies were implicitly estimating substitution effects but this was not explicitly stated in most study aims, interpretation or conclusions. Our meta-scientific review found little evidence that the energy adjustment strategies of the primary studies were being considered in the synthesis or interpretation of evidence. Consequently, the pooled estimates reflect ill-defined quantities with unclear interpretations. We offer recommendations to improve the conduct of future meta-analyses and the quality of evidence that informs nutritional recommendations."

In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect."

    "abstract": "When a molecule contains more than a few atoms, its full-dimensional dynamics becomes untractable, especially when introducing temperature effects. In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath. In this prospect, we extend the effective bath state (EBS) method that we had first developed and benchmarked in [J. Chem. Phys. \\textbf{160}, 044107 (2024)] to describe the spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics of complex isolated molecules. The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. It allows for a significant reduction of the bath dimension and makes finite-temperature calculations more accessible. In order to treat a realistic molecule, the method is extended to include polynomial couplings in the bath coordinates. The ability of the method to model temperature-resolved infrared spectra and to follow population transfers between the vibrational modes of the molecule is first tested on a 10-mode model system. The extended method is then applied to the realistic case of phenylacetylene."

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are fundamental in applications across navigation, transportation, and industrial networks. However, their extremely low received power makes them highly vulnerable to radio-frequency interference (RFI) and intentional jamming. Modern data-driven methods offer powerful representational power for such applications, however real-time and reliable jamming detection on resource-limited embedded receivers remains a key challenge due to the high computational and memory demands of the conventional learning paradigm. To address these challenges, this work presents a dictionary-based contrastive learning (DBCL) framework for GNSS jamming detection that integrates transfer learning, contrastive representation learning, and model compression techniques. The framework combines tuned contrastive and dictionary-based loss functions to enhance feature separability under low-data conditions and applies structured pruning and knowledge distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive evaluation across varying data regimes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms modern CNN, MobileViT, and ResNet-18 architectures. The framework achieves a substantial reduction in memory footprint and inference latency, confirming its suitability for real-time, low-power GNSS interference detection on embedded platforms."

    "abstract": "Synchronization transmission describes the emergence of coherence between two uncoupled oscillators mediated by their mutual coupling to an intermediate one. In classical star networks, such mediated coupling gives rise to remote synchronization--where nonadjacent leaf nodes synchronize through a nonsynchronous hub--and to explosive synchronization, characterized by an abrupt collective transition to coherence. In the quantum regime, analogous effects can arise from the interplay between 1:1 phase locking and 2:1 phase-locking blockade in coupled spin-1 oscillators. In this work, we investigate a star network composed of spin-1 oscillators. For identical oscillators, symmetric and asymmetric dissipation lead to distinct transmission behaviors: remote synchronization and quasi-explosive synchronization appear in different coupling regimes, a phenomenon absent in classical counterparts. For nonidentical networks, we find that at large detuning remote synchronization emerges in the weak-coupling regime and evolves into quasi-explosive synchronization as the coupling increases, consistent with classical star-network dynamics. These findings reveal the rich dynamical characteristics of mediated quantum synchronization and point toward new possibilities for exploring synchronization transmission in larger and more complex quantum systems."

Using coupled mode theory, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and further validate it via numerical simulations on practical stacked structures. In the EP-QBIC regime, the mode quality (Q) factor can be enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Moreover, we systematically investigate the formation conditions for EP-QBIC states and conventional QBICs. Additionally, introducing an excitation-phase degree of freedom in a pure plasmonic structure allows the Q factor to increase by over 15 times due to QBIC formation-even breaking through the limit imposed by material loss."

    "abstract": "The problem of low-tubal-rank tensor estimation is a fundamental task with wide applications across high-dimensional signal processing, machine learning, and image science. Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number. Extensive simulations on synthetic data are carried out to validate our theoretical assertions."

However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the \"Memory Trap\". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts."

The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties.

Across eight reasoning benchmarks, NPR trained on Qwen3-4B achieves performance gains of up to 24.5% and inference speedups up to 4.6x.

Second, we introduce a generative animation model that fully exploits the diversity of limited motion data. We focus on short-term transitions while maintaining long-term consistency through an identity-conditioned design. These two designs formulate our method as a two-stage framework: the first stage learns a latent space, while the second learns to generate animations within this latent space. We conducted experiments on both our latent space and animation model. We demonstrate that our latent space produces high-fidelity human geometry surpassing previous methods ($90\\%$ lower Chamfer Dist.).

We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions."

Detection of this \"anisotropic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect\" will allow us to independently measure the anisotropy multipoles with $\\ell=1,2,3$, separate the Sachs-Wolf effect from the integrated Sachs-Wolf effect (Rees-Sciama effect) and, to a certain extent, circumvent the 'cosmic variance' problem for low multipoles. We propose a modified Least Response Method for the components separation in the data processing and estimate the required sensitivity of the experiment for such observations. We test our approach on a simulated signal that is contaminated by various foregrounds with poorly defined spectral shapes, along with distortions of the relic blackbody spectrum caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and its relativistic corrections."

Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed. This report serves as a preliminary study for future developments in KAN-based world models."

For uncharged black holes, these observables access the geometry all the way to the vicinity of the singularity, while for charged black holes, they only probe up to the inner horizon. Under appropriate conditions, the near-singularity geometry takes the universal form of a Kasner spacetime, characterized by the Kasner exponents. By introducing scalar hair, it is possible to continuously vary the Kasner exponents away from their vacuum values. In this work, we study the behavior of two different observables to determine whether they remain viable holographic duals of complexity in the presence of scalar hair. We also investigate how deeply these observables can probe the Kasner regime near the singularity. To this end, we consider two scalar potentials: an exponential potential, which admits analytic solutions, and a pure mass term, which requires numerical analysis."

Deviating slightly from the latter by introducing a homogeneous and isotropic initial velocity dispersion, we show that all higher momentum cumulants are generated dynamically at any perturbative order. We support our numerical solutions by an analytical large-scale approximation.

While many recent works seek to enhance CNNs with global contextual understanding via self-attention-based Vision Transformers, these approaches often introduce significant computational overhead. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to retain strong global perception without relying on computationally expensive components. We present GlimmerNet, an ultra-lightweight convolutional network built on the principle of separating receptive field diversity from feature recombination. GlimmerNet introduces Grouped Dilated Depthwise Convolutions(GDBlocks), which partition channels into groups with distinct dilation rates, enabling multi-scale feature extraction at no additional parameter cost. To fuse these features efficiently, we design a novel Aggregator module that recombines cross-group representations using grouped pointwise convolution, significantly lowering parameter overhead. With just 31K parameters and 29% fewer FLOPs than the most recent baseline, GlimmerNet achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 0.966 on the UAV-focused AIDERv2 dataset. These results establish a new accuracy-efficiency trade-off frontier for real-time emergency monitoring on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

This study combines ground-based observations conducted at a Southern Hemisphere observatory in Argentina with data from the TESS mission. Investigating the orbital period variations of EZ Oct reveals a steadily increasing period consistent with a quadratic trend. We present a new ephemeris and estimate the mass transfer rate as \\dot{M}=1.353*10^{-8} M_{\\odot}/year, indicating ongoing conservative mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star. Light curve modeling was performed using the PHOEBE Python code in conjunction with the MCMC approach, and the inclusion of a cold starspot was required to achieve an adequate fit. Absolute parameters were estimated using Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysical equations. Our analysis shows that EZ Oct is a total-eclipse contact binary with a mass ratio of 1.969, a fillout factor of 0.106, and an inclination of 82.13deg. Based on the stellar masses and temperatures of the components, the target system belongs to the W-subtype of contact binaries. The positions of the component stars were displayed on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams to illustrate their evolutionary status. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between orbital period and stellar luminosity in contact binary stars using a sample of 461 systems with P<0.5 days. We highlight the position of EZ Oct in the mass ratio-inclination parameter space, showing that it lies within the densely populated region of contact binaries."

We verify that the algorithm satisfies next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy criteria, from numerical fixed-order tests as well as resummation tests across a range of observables. Our conclusion is that jet recoils provide a viable path for adapting existing dipole/antenna-type showers to achieve NLL accuracy."

The processing pipeline includes automatic language detection, filtering of non-relevant content, extraction of relevant segments, and enrichment with structural metadata. From this initial corpus, a derived dataset in English is created for machine learning purposes. For each occurrence of a term from the expert lexicon, a contextual block of five sentences is extracted (two preceding and two following the sentence containing the term). Each occurrence is annotated with the thematic category associated with the term, enabling the construction of data suitable for supervised classification tasks.

Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes."

However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks."

While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems."

In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$) acts as $\\mathbf{G}(n)=\\exp(n\\,ω\\,\\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\\mathbf{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

We utilized the natural orbitals to refine the ASCC solution for simple valence and Rydberg systems, exploring the process of repeatedly solving the ASCC equations in successive natural orbital bases to achieve independence from the starting molecular orbitals. For dipole moments in small molecules where high-level comparison data is available, we find that the accuracy of ASCC essentially matches that of linear response and equation-of-motion coupled cluster as long as care is taken to preserve the response's perturbative completeness."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential. Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.

Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, M$_{\\rm x-ray}$ ~ 4.5x10$^{8}$M$_{\\odot}$ (FIRST J120041) and M$_{\\rm x-ray}$ ~ 1.8x10$^{8}$M$_{\\odot}$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses (volume-normalized) by factors of ~4 and ~16, respectively. In 2MASX J130038, we also identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$α$ line at E$_{\\rm rest}$ = 7.14 $\\pm$ 0.06 keV (v~7600 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a nascent hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback."

But with the ever growing complexity of applications, and user needs, areas of the infrastructure that previously required minimal load balancing, now must be made more robust and proactive to application load. In our work we explore how to build and design such a system that focuses on load balancing over key compute resources and properties of these applications.

    "abstract": "Hybrid quantum systems harness the distinct advantages of different physical platforms, yet their integration is not always trivial due to potential incompatibilities in operational principles. Here, we theoretically propose and demonstrate a scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical states using a strongly driven hybrid system that combines cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics. Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors."

We show that the BPS equations can be decoupled, and we study the geometries perturbatively and numerically. Applying the holographic dictionary, we compute the expectation values of light chiral primaries in these backgrounds. This data allows us to determine the dual CFT state up to quadratic order in the fluctuations. The resulting state is expressed as a linear combination of half-BPS double-trace states, and of the lightest quarter-BPS state of the theory. Our analysis reveals that protected quarter-BPS operators, including their subleading $1/N$ corrections, can be fully reconstructed from supergravity alone. Finally, we perform consistency checks of the result."

    "abstract": "We study the phase-ordering dynamics of a quasi-classical Holstein model. At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."

    "abstract": "Chifan-Ioana (2010) implies that, for any factor of IID percolation on any nonamenable Cayley graph $G$, there is a countable set of (strong) indistinguishability classes for non-hyperfinite clusters. We introduce quantitative strengthenings, called (qI) and (qSI): for $η$-non-hyperfinite clusters, there are at most $M(G,η)<\\infty$ (strong) indistinguishability classes, for any FIID percolation. We first show that (qI) and (qSI) for any $G$ are equivalent to the ``sparse implies thin'' property (SiT): any FIID percolation with $η$-non-hyperfinite clusters has density at least $c(G,η)>0$. Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs. On the other hand, recent work of Jardón-Sánchez, Mellick, Poulin, and Wróbel implies that (SiT) fails for weak FIIDs on non-exact, i.e., not property (A) groups. Furthermore, (SiT) implies that the Bernoulli graphing over any non-hyperfinite FIID cluster is strongly ergodic, and that indistinguishability for non-hyperfinite FIID clusters is equivalent to strong indistinguishability. These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs. We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters. On Kazhdan groups, there must be a single such cluster. Our results have finite counterparts: in any large girth $d$-regular graph sequence, any FIID subgraph of average degree at least $2+δ$ must have density at least $c(d,δ)>0$. In the uniform random d-regular graph $G_{n,d}$, this holds for every subgraph of average degree at least $2+δ$."

Quantum error correction (QEC) bridges this gap, but depends on decoders being simultaneously fast, accurate, and scalable. This combination of requirements has not yet been met by a machine-learning decoder, nor by any decoder for promising resource-efficient codes such as the colour code. Here we introduce AlphaQubit 2, a neural-network decoder that achieves near-optimal logical error rates for both surface and colour codes at large scales under realistic noise. For the colour code, it is orders of magnitude faster than other high-accuracy decoders. For the surface code, we demonstrate real-time decoding faster than 1 microsecond per cycle up to distance 11 on current commercial accelerators with better accuracy than leading real-time decoders. These results support the practical application of a wider class of promising QEC codes, and establish a credible path towards high-accuracy, real-time neural decoding at the scales required for fault-tolerant quantum computation."

A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\\%p improvement in CHAIR\\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach.

    "abstract": "Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants."

To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/wiarae/NPC."

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate optimal control of a Brinkman equation couple with sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is endowed with a source term accounting for mass exchange and the velocity equation contains a non divergence-free forcing term, which act as distributed control variable. We consider the aforementioned system with constant mobility, viscosity and nonlinearity of double-well shape is regular. The cost functional of the optimal control problem contains a nondifferentiable term like the $L^1$-norm with sparsity constant $κ$, which leads to sparsity of optimal controls. We study the first order necessary optimality condition for both the case $κ=0$ and $κ>0.$ When the cost functional is differentiable, first order necessary optimality conditions are characterized by Lagrange multiplier method and for nondifferentiable case we have used the idea of Casas and Tröltzsch from the paper (Math. control Relat. Fields, 10(3):527-546, 2020)."

    "abstract": "Deep learning holds immense promise for transforming medical image analysis, yet its clinical generalization remains profoundly limited. A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data. Our code and weights will be made publicly available upon publication."

    "abstract": "Large language models sometimes assert falsehoods despite internally representing the correct answer, failures of honesty rather than accuracy, which undermines auditability and safety. Existing approaches largely optimize factual correctness or depend on retraining and brittle single-layer edits, offering limited leverage over truthful reporting. We present a training-free activation steering method that weights steering strength across network depth using a Gaussian schedule. On the MASK benchmark, which separates honesty from knowledge, we evaluate seven models spanning the LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral families and find that Gaussian scheduling improves honesty over no-steering and single-layer baselines in six of seven models. Equal-budget ablations on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct show the Gaussian schedule outperforms random, uniform, and box-filter depth allocations, indicating that how intervention is distributed across depth materially affects outcomes beyond total strength. The method is simple, model-agnostic, requires no finetuning, and provides a low-cost control knob for eliciting truthful reporting from models' existing capabilities."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in code intelligence tasks such as code generation, summarization, and translation. However, their reliance on linearized token sequences limits their ability to understand the structural semantics of programs. While prior studies have explored graphaugmented prompting and structure-aware pretraining, they either suffer from prompt length constraints or require task-specific architectural changes that are incompatible with large-scale instructionfollowing LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CGBridge, a novel plug-and-play method that enhances LLMs with Code Graph information through an external, trainable Bridge module. CGBridge first pre-trains a code graph encoder via selfsupervised learning on a large-scale dataset of 270K code graphs to learn structural code semantics. It then trains an external module to bridge the modality gap among code, graph, and text by aligning their semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. Finally, the bridge module generates structure-informed prompts, which are injected into a frozen LLM, and is fine-tuned for downstream code intelligence tasks. Experiments show that CGBridge achieves notable improvements over both the original model and the graphaugmented prompting method. Specifically, it yields a 16.19% and 9.12% relative gain in LLM-as-a-Judge on code summarization, and a 9.84% and 38.87% relative gain in Execution Accuracy on code translation. Moreover, CGBridge achieves over 4x faster inference than LoRA-tuned models, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in structure-aware code understanding."

    "abstract": "As organisations increasingly recognise data as a strategic resource, they face the challenge of translating informational assets into measurable business value. Existing valuation approaches remain fragmented, often separating economic, governance, and strategic perspectives and lacking operational mechanisms suitable for real settings. This paper introduces a unified valuation framework that integrates these perspectives into a coherent decision-support model. Building on two artefacts from the Horizon Europe DATAMITE project, a taxonomy of data-quality and performance metrics, and an Analytic Network Process (ANP) tool for deriving relative importance, we develop a hybrid valuation model. The model combines qualitative scoring, cost- and utility-based estimation, relevance/quality indexing, and multi-criteria weighting to define data value transparently and systematically. Anchored in the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), the framework aligns indicators and valuation outcomes with organisational strategy, enabling firms to assess monetisation potential across Data-as-a-Service, Information-as-a-Service, and Answers-as-a-Service pathways. Methodologically, the study follows a Design Science approach complemented by embedded case studies with industrial partners, which informed continual refinement of the model. Because the evaluation is connected to a high-level taxonomy, the approach also reveals how valuation considerations map to BSC perspectives. Across the analysed use cases, the framework demonstrated flexibility, transparency, and reduced arbitrariness in valuation, offering organisations a structured basis for linking data assets to strategic and economic outcomes."

We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+ε)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \\propto δ_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}γ_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $γ_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $γ_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims."

This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments."

The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task. This algorithm is called B* and it combines aspects of beam search and A* along with backtracking to force pretrained transformers to satisfy the chord constraints, at the correct onset position within the correct bar. The algorithm is brute-force and has exponential complexity in the worst case; however, this paper is a first attempt to highlight the difficulties of the problem and proposes an algorithm that offers many possibilities for improvements since it accommodates the involvement of heuristics."

Prior benchmarks show that machine learning and deep learning models provide only modest gains over statistical baselines, mainly due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the DF time series. We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default. Our study highlights the generalization capability and data efficiency of TSFMs for process-related time series and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first systematic evaluation of temporal foundation models for PMF."

However building these networks in hardware respecting both tight energy and memory budgets, remains a core challenge in the field. We address this challenge through novel algorithm-hardware co-design effort. At the algorithm level, inspired by the cortical fast-slow organization in the brain, we introduce a neural network with an explicit slow memory pathway that, combined with fast spiking activity, enables a dual memory pathway (DMP) architecture in which each layer maintains a compact low-dimensional state that summarizes recent activity and modulates spiking dynamics. This explicit memory stabilizes learning while preserving event-driven sparsity, achieving competitive accuracy on long-sequence benchmarks with 40-60% fewer parameters than equivalent state-of-the-art spiking neural networks. At the hardware level, we introduce a near-memory-compute architecture that fully leverages the advantages of the DMP architecture by retaining its compact shared state while optimizing dataflow, across heterogeneous sparse-spike and dense-memory pathways. We show experimental results that demonstrate more than a 4x increase in throughput and over a 5x improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art implementations. Together, these contributions demonstrate that biological principles can guide functional abstractions that are both algorithmically effective and hardware-efficient, establishing a scalable co-design paradigm for real-time neuromorphic computation and learning."

Consequently, these methods do not reveal the analytic structure of the optimal quaternion. In this work, we derive an explicit analytical characterization of all quaternions that yield zero Wahba cost for the case $\\ell=2$. Our approach builds on a connection between quaternion similarity, the singular Sylvester equation $aq=qb$, and quaternion square roots established in our previous work [1].

The co-2-plexes of a graph are known to be in bijection with the stable sets of an auxiliary graph called the utter graph~\\cite{dupontbouillard2024contractions}. We use this bijection to characterize contraction perfect graphs' co-2-plex polytopes in an extended space. It turns out that the total dual integrality of the associated linear system also characterizes contraction perfectness of the input graph. By projecting this extended space formulation, we obtain the natural variable space description of the co-2-plex polytopes of trees. This projection yields a new family of valid inequalities for the co-2-plex polytope and we characterize when they define facets. Moreover, we show that these inequalities can be separated in polynomial time. We characterize the graphs for which this formulation describes an integer polytope. These linear systems are extended to valid integer linear programs (ILPs) for the maximum co-2-plex problem whose linear relaxation values are tighter than the state of the art for this problem~\\cite{bala}. Finally, we provide an experimental comparison of several implementations of our new ILP formulations with the state-of-the-art ILP for this problem and analyze their respective performances relatively to the density of the input graphs."

Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold, Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi-curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real-world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph's local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures."

The governing equation involves a Caputo fractional derivative with respect to time of order $γ$ in (0,1) and a fractional Laplacian in the spatial variables of order $s$ in (0,1). The system is associated with two independent controls, each aiming at different targets. The problem is formulated as a distributed optimal control system with quadratic cost functionals. Existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are established under convexity and coercivity assumptions. The solution is computed using conjugate gradient algorithms applied iteratively to the discretized optimal control problems. The numerical experiments agree with the theoretical estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme."

By solving the system's time evolution under cyclic unitary processes, we analyze how external parameters such as temperature, magnetic field, and DM interaction influence the charging behavior and quantum resources of the battery. The findings demonstrate that quantum coherence and DM interaction significantly enhance the energy storage efficiency and power output of the quantum battery, offering promising strategies for designing high-performance quantum energy storage devices. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of quantum battery under the influence of a common dephasing environment, which limits the long-term work-extraction capability of dipolar quantum batteries."

The scheme follows a source-device-independent (SDI) security model in which the entropy originates from quantum measurement uncertainty and no model of the source is required; security depends only on the trusted measurement device and the calibrated discretization, and thus remains valid even under adversarial state preparation. The optical field is split by a 90$^\\circ$ optical hybrid and measured by two balanced photodiodes to obtain both quadratures of the vacuum state simultaneously. The analog outputs are digitized using a dual-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter operating at a sampling rate of 3.2 GS/s per channel, and processed in real time by an FPGA implementing Toeplitz hashing for randomness extraction. The quantum-to-classical noise ratio was verified through calibrated power spectral density measurements and cross-checked in the time domain, confirming vacuum-noise dominance within the 1.6 GHz detection bandwidth. After extraction, the system achieves a sustained generation rate of $R_{\\rm net}= 33.92~\\mathrm{Gbit/s}$ of uniformly distributed random bits, which pass all NIST and Dieharder statistical tests. The demonstrated platform provides a compact, FPGA-based realization of a practical heterodyne continuous-variable source-independent QRNG suitable for high-rate quantum communication and secure key distribution systems."

    "abstract": "Large language models have the potential to generate explanations for their own predictions in a variety of styles based on user instructions. Recent research has examined whether these self-explanations faithfully reflect the models' actual behavior and has found that they often lack faithfulness. However, the question of how to improve faithfulness remains underexplored. Moreover, because different explanation styles have superficially distinct characteristics, it is unclear whether improvements observed in one style also arise when using other styles. This study analyzes the effects of training for faithful self-explanations and the extent to which these effects generalize, using three classification tasks and three explanation styles. We construct one-word constrained explanations that are likely to be faithful using a feature attribution method, and use these pseudo-faithful self-explanations for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. Our experiments demonstrate that training can improve self-explanation faithfulness across all classification tasks and explanation styles, and that these improvements also show signs of generalization to the multi-word settings and to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we find consistent cross-style generalization among three styles, suggesting that training may contribute to a broader improvement in faithful self-explanation ability."

For this purpose, we expand quantum kinetic equations using weak fields and slow temporal scales as expansion parameters. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the Dirac field can be described by classical-like distribution functions for electrons and positrons, which are weakly coupled through quantum interactions. Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles. The implications of our results are discussed."

We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance.

Linear subspaces have emerged as a suitable model for tile clusters; however, they are not well matched to images patches given that images are non-negative and thus not distributed around the origin in the tile vector space. We study the use of affine subspace models for the clusters to better match the geometric structure of the image tile vector space. We also present a simple denoising algorithm that relies on the affine subspace clustering model using least squares projection. We review several algorithmic approaches to solve the affine subspace clustering problem and show experimental results that highlight the performance improvements in clustering and denoising."

The essential problem for such a data type is to determine nodes that carry greater importance than all the others, a task that markedly enhances system monitoring and management. Traditional methods to identify important nodes in networks introduce centrality measures, such as node degree or more complex PageRank. However, they consider only the network structure, neglecting the rich node attributes. Recent methods adopt neural networks capable of handling node features, but they require supervision. This work addresses the identified gap--the absence of approaches that are both unsupervised and attribute-aware--by introducing a Pipeline for Important Node Exploration (PINE). At the core of the proposed framework is an attention-based graph model that incorporates node semantic features in the learning process of identifying the structural graph properties. The PINE's node importance scores leverage the obtained attention distribution. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed PINE method on various homogeneous and heterogeneous attributed networks. As an industry-implemented system, PINE tackles the real-world challenge of unsupervised identification of key entities within large-scale enterprise graphs."

We show that the interplay between nonlinear evolution and horizon dissipation in general relativity drives dynamical AdS black branes towards the final state along a unique path, independent of their initial perturbations. Through numerical simulations, we identify this late-time attractor and uncover the associated universal nonlinear behavior, characterized by a simple dimensionless relative amplitude in the dual hydrodynamic variables."

In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories."

Accordingly, this study aims to characterize the interactions between the lane-changing vehicle (active vehicle) and the vehicle directly impacted by the maneuver in the target lane (passive vehicle). Utilizing real-world trajectory data from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), this study explores patterns in lane-changing behavior and provides insight into how these behaviors evolve under different AV market penetration rates (MPRs). In particular, we propose a game-theoretic framework to analyze cooperative and defective behaviors in mixed traffic, applied to the 7,636 observed lane-changing events in the WOMD. First, we utilize k-means clustering to classify vehicles as cooperative or defective, revealing that the proportions of cooperative AVs are higher than those of HDVs in both active and passive roles. Next, we jointly estimate the utilities of active and passive vehicles to model their behaviors using the quantal response equilibrium framework. Empirical payoff tables are then constructed based on these utilities. Using these payoffs, we analyze the presence of social dilemmas and examine the evolution of cooperative behaviors using evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal the presence of social dilemmas in approximately 4% and 11% of lane-changing events for active and passive vehicles, respectively, with most classified as Stag Hunt or Prisoner's Dilemma (Chicken Game rarely observed). Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation results show that repeated lane-changing interactions consistently lead to increased cooperative behavior over time, regardless of the AV penetration rate."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks demonstrate that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning without any fine-tuning, showcasing the advantage of neuro-symbolic integration in enhancing temporal understanding in large language models."

    "abstract": "The productivity of a planetary biosphere is limited by how its free-energy budget is partitioned between maintaining a habitable environment, driving metabolism, and processing heritable information. We derive an upper bound on net primary productivity (NPP) from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and information theory, given a planet's usable free-energy flux and a few coarse-grained biological parameters. The bound subtracts an irreducible power cost of heritable information processing -- set by global template-copying rates, copying fidelity, alphabet size, and proofreading work -- from the planetary power budget before converting the remainder into biomass. This yields an ``information-productivity trade-off'': at fixed planetary power, higher copying rates, lower error rates, larger alphabets, or more intensive proofreading all lower the ceiling on biomass production. Using conservative parameter choices, we show that Earth lies well below this ceiling, whereas low-flux environments such as M-dwarf habitable zones and subsurface ocean worlds can be driven into an information-limited regime where only modest combinations of productivity and heritable complexity are attainable. We outline how future exoplanet observations of stellar irradiation, climate, atmospheric disequilibria, and temporal variability could be used to place physics-based upper limits on NPP and compare them with independent productivity estimates."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful explicit representation enabling real-time, high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, its practical use is hindered by the massive memory and computational demands required to store and render millions of Gaussians. These challenges become even more severe in 4D dynamic scenes. To address these issues, the field of Efficient Gaussian Splatting has rapidly evolved, proposing methods that reduce redundancy while preserving reconstruction quality. This survey provides the first unified overview of efficient 3D and 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques. For both 3D and 4D settings, we systematically categorize existing methods into two major directions, Parameter Compression and Restructuring Compression, and comprehensively summarize the core ideas and methodological trends within each category. We further cover widely used datasets, evaluation metrics, and representative benchmark comparisons. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising research directions toward scalable, compact, and real-time Gaussian Splatting for both static and dynamic 3D scene representation."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to intensity inhomogeneity, noise, blurred boundaries, and irregular structures. Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods."

    "abstract": "As multimodal data proliferates across diverse real-world applications, leveraging heterogeneous information such as texts and timestamps for accurate time series forecasting (TSF) has become a critical challenge. While diffusion models demonstrate exceptional performance in generation tasks, their application to TSF remains largely confined to modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the abundant cross-modal signals inherent in complex heterogeneous data. To address this gap, we propose UniDiff, a unified diffusion framework for multimodal time series forecasting. To process the numerical sequence, our framework first tokenizes the time series into patches, preserving local temporal dynamics by mapping each patch to an embedding space via a lightweight MLP. At its core lies a unified and parallel fusion module, where a single cross-attention mechanism adaptively weighs and integrates structural information from timestamps and semantic context from texts in one step, enabling a flexible and efficient interplay between modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism designed for multi-source conditioning, allowing for decoupled control over the guidance strength of textual and temporal information during inference, which significantly enhances model robustness. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed UniDiff model achieves state-of-the-art performance."

    "abstract": "Robots operating in everyday environments must often decide when and whether to engage with people, yet such decisions often hinge on subtle nonverbal cues that unfold over time and are difficult to model explicitly. Drawing on a five-day Wizard-of-Oz deployment of a mobile service robot in a university cafe, we analyze how people signal interaction readiness through nonverbal behaviors and how expert wizards use these cues to guide engagement. Motivated by these observations, we propose a two-stage pipeline in which lightweight perceptual detectors (gaze shifts and proxemics) are used to selectively trigger heavier video-based vision-language model (VLM) queries at socially meaningful moments. We evaluate this pipeline on replayed field interactions and compare two prompting strategies. Our findings suggest that selectively using VLMs as proxies for social reasoning enables socially responsive robot behavior, allowing robots to act appropriately by attending to the cues people naturally provide in real-world interactions."

    "abstract": "We introduce a two-stage self-supervised framework that combines the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with a Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) for learning robust speech representations. Stage~1 uses JEPA with DAAM to learn semantic audio features via masked prediction in latent space, fully decoupled from waveform reconstruction. Stage~2 leverages these representations for efficient tokenization using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a mixed-radix packing scheme, followed by high-fidelity waveform reconstruction with a HiFi-GAN decoder. By integrating Gaussian mixture-based density-adaptive gating into the JEPA encoder, the model performs adaptive temporal feature selection and discovers hierarchical speech structure at a low frame rate of 2.5~Hz. The resulting tokens (47.5 tokens/sec) provide a reversible, highly compressed, and language-model-friendly representation that is competitive with, and often more efficient than, existing neural audio codecs."

    "abstract": "Privacy leakage in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has long been an intractable problem. Existing studies, though effectively obscure private information in MLLMs, often overlook the evaluation of the authenticity and recovery quality of user privacy. To this end, this work uniquely focuses on the critical challenge of how to restore surrogate-driven protected data in diverse MLLM scenarios. We first bridge this research gap by contributing the SPPE (Surrogate Privacy Protected Editable) dataset, which includes a wide range of privacy categories and user instructions to simulate real MLLM applications. This dataset offers protected surrogates alongside their various MLLM-edited versions, thus enabling the direct assessment of privacy recovery quality. By formulating privacy recovery as a guided generation task conditioned on complementary multimodal signals, we further introduce a unified approach that reliably reconstructs private content while preserving the fidelity of MLLM-generated edits. The experiments on both SPPE and InstructPix2Pix further show that our approach generalizes well across diverse visual content and editing tasks, achieving a strong balance between privacy protection and MLLM usability."

    "abstract": "Sparse-view 3D Gaussian splatting seeks to render high-quality novel views of 3D scenes from a limited set of input images. While recent pose-free feed-forward methods leveraging pre-trained 3D priors have achieved impressive results, most of them rely on full fine-tuning of large Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones and incur substantial GPU costs. In this work, we introduce MuSASplat, a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of training pose-free feed-forward 3D Gaussian splats models with little compromise of rendering quality. Central to our approach is a lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter that enables efficient fine-tuning of ViT-based architectures with only a small fraction of training parameters. This design avoids the prohibitive GPU overhead associated with previous full-model adaptation techniques while maintaining high fidelity in novel view synthesis, even with very sparse input views. In addition, we introduce a Feature Fusion Aggregator that integrates features across input views effectively and efficiently. Unlike widely adopted memory banks, the Feature Fusion Aggregator ensures consistent geometric integration across input views and meanwhile mitigates the memory usage, training complexity, and computational costs significantly. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that MuSASplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has significantly reduced parameters and training resource requirements as compared with existing methods."

    "abstract": "The existence of three distinct neutrino flavours, $ν_{e}$, $ν_μ$, and $ν_τ$, is a central tenet of the Standard Model of particle physics. Quantum-mechanical interference can allow a neutrino of one initial flavour to be detected some time later as a different flavour, a process called neutrino oscillation. Several anomalous observations inconsistent with this three-flavour picture have motivated the hypothesis that an additional neutrino state exists which does not interact directly with matter, termed a \"sterile\" neutrino, $ν_s$. This includes anomalous observations from the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments, consistent with $ν_μ\\rightarrowν_{e}$ transitions at a distance inconsistent with the three-neutrino picture. Here, we use data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber in two accelerator neutrino beams to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95\\% confidence level (CL). Additionally, we rule out a significant portion of the parameter space that could explain the gallium anomaly. This is the first measurement to use two accelerator neutrino beams to break a degeneracy between $ν_{e}$ appearance and disappearance that would otherwise weaken the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino hypothesis. We find no evidence for either $ν_μ\\rightarrowν_{e}$ flavour transitions or $ν_{e}$ disappearance that would indicate non-standard flavour oscillations. Our results show that previous anomalous observations consistent with $ν_μ\\rightarrowν_{e}$ transitions cannot be explained by introducing a single sterile neutrino state."

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense pulses with unknown origins. A subclass of repeating FRBs show some common features, such as associated compact persistent radio sources (PRSs), high burst rates, and large host-galaxy dispersion measures (DMs). Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs. Our results support a unified population of active FRBs in dynamic magnetized environments."

Compared with the existing works on time-varying formation tracking control, the region constraint is takeninto account in this paper, which ensures the safety of the robots.Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement."

Existing methods suffer from the discrepancies between the generated clothing results and the target ones, in terms of the patterns, textures and boundaries. Therefore, we propose to use an energy function to impose constraints on the attention map extracted through the generation process. Thus, at each generation step, the attention can be more focused on the clothing region of interest, thereby influencing the generation results to be more consistent with the target clothing details. Furthermore, to address the limitation that existing evaluation metrics concentrate solely on image realism and overlook the alignment with target elements, we design a new metric, Virtual Try-on Inception Distance (VTID), to bridge this gap and ensure a more comprehensive assessment. On the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets, our approach has outperformed the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 1.4%, 2.3%, 12.3%, and 5.8% in the traditional metrics of LPIPS, FID, KID, and the new VTID metrics, respectively.

    "abstract": "Flight control software is typically designed with numerous configurable parameters governing multiple functionalities, enabling flexible adaptation to mission diversity and environmental uncertainty. Although developers and manufacturers usually provide recommendations for these parameters to ensure safe and stable operations, certain combinations of parameters with recommended values may still lead to unstable flight behaviors, thereby degrading the drone's robustness. To this end, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based approach for real-time repair of risk-prone configurations (named RisConFix) that degrade drone robustness. RisConFix continuously monitors the drone's operational state and automatically triggers a repair mechanism once abnormal flight behaviors are detected. The repair mechanism leverages an LLM to analyze relationships between configuration parameters and flight states, and then generates corrective parameter updates to restore flight stability. To ensure the validity of the updated configuration, RisConFix operates as an iterative process; it continuously monitors the drone's flight state and, if an anomaly persists after applying an update, automatically triggers the next repair cycle. We evaluated RisConFix through a case study of ArduPilot (with 1,421 groups of misconfigurations). Experimental results show that RisConFix achieved a best repair success rate of 97% and an optimal average number of repairs of 1.17, demonstrating its capability to effectively and efficiently repair risk-prone configurations in real time."

Many such systems leverage soft components, which enable shape morphing but also introduce simulation and control challenges. Soft-body simulators remain limited in accuracy and computational tractability, while rigid-body simulators cannot capture soft-material dynamics. Here, we present a surrogate compliance modeling approach: rather than explicitly modeling soft-body physics, we introduce indirect variables representing soft-material deformation within a rigid-body simulator. We validate this approach using our amphibious robotic turtle, a quadruped with soft morphing limbs designed for multi-environment locomotion. By capturing deformation effects as changes in effective limb length and limb center of mass, and by applying reinforcement learning with extensive randomization of these indirect variables, we achieve reliable policy learning entirely in a rigid-body simulation. The resulting gaits transfer directly to hardware, demonstrating high-fidelity sim-to-real performance on hard, flat substrates and robust, though lower-fidelity, transfer on rheologically complex terrains. The learned closed-loop gaits exhibit unprecedented terrestrial maneuverability and achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost of transport compared to open-loop baselines. Field experiments with the robot further demonstrate stable, multi-gait locomotion across diverse natural terrains, including gravel, grass, and mud."

This approach belongs to the family of bound-state techniques for the continuum, reformulating scattering problems into a localized, square-integrable ($L^2$) representation. The key feature is the direct incorporation of the outgoing wave boundary condition into the last row of the matrix equation, eliminating the need for Bloch operators and two-step matching procedures required in traditional R-matrix methods. Unlike the complex scaling method that rotates coordinates into the complex plane, DBMM operates entirely in real coordinate space. The formalism is extended to coupled-channel problems, where the wave function decomposition naturally leads to an effective source potential that distinguishes between the entrance channel and other channels. Benchmark calculations for p~+~$^{12}$C scattering demonstrate excellent agreement with the Numerov integration method."

Meanwhile, community detection methods typically ignore textual semantics, limiting their usefulness in downstream applications such as content organization, recommendation, and risk monitoring. To overcome these limitations, we present Dual Refinement Cycle Learning (DRCL), a fully unsupervised framework designed for practical scenarios where no labels or category definitions are available. DRCL integrates structural and semantic information through a warm-start initialization and a bidirectional refinement cycle between a GCN-based Community Detection Module (GCN-CDM) and a Text Semantic Modeling Module (TSMM). The two modules iteratively exchange pseudo-labels, allowing semantic cues to enhance structural clustering and structural patterns to guide text representation learning without manual supervision. Across several text-attributed graph datasets, DRCL consistently improves the structural and semantic quality of discovered communities. Moreover, a Mamba-based classifier trained solely from DRCL's community signals achieves accuracy comparable to supervised models, demonstrating its potential for deployment in large-scale systems where labeled data are scarce or costly."

    "abstract": "Randomization tests yield exact finite-sample Type 1 error control when the null satisfies the randomization hypothesis. However, achieving these guarantees in practice often requires stronger conditions than the null hypothesis of primary interest. For instance, sign-change tests for mean zero require symmetry and fail to control finite-sample error for non-symmetric mean-zero distributions. We investigate whether such limitations stem from specific test choices or reflect a fundamental inability to construct valid randomization tests for certain hypotheses. We develop a framework providing a simple necessary and sufficient condition for when null hypotheses admit randomization tests. Applying this framework to one-sample tests, we provide characterizations of which nulls satisfy this condition for both finite and continuous supports. In doing so, we prove that certain null hypotheses -- including mean zero -- do not admit randomization tests. We further show that nulls that admit randomization tests based on linear group actions correspond only to subsets of symmetric or normal distributions. Overall, our findings affirm that practitioners are not inadvertently incurring additional Type 1 error when using existing tests and further motivate focusing on the asymptotic validity of randomization tests."

A Fekete-Szëgo-type approximation argument then produces a polynomial \"large\" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational components in a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, embodied intelligence, and scientific discovery. As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure."

Our analysis reveals a divergence between \"solvability\" (stock-termination rate) and route quality; high solvability scores often mask chemical invalidity or fail to correlate with the reproduction of experimental ground truths. Furthermore, we identify a \"complexity cliff\" in which search-based methods, despite high solvability rates, exhibit a sharp performance decay in reconstructing long-range synthetic plans compared to sequence-based approaches. We release the full framework, benchmark definitions, and a standardized database of model predictions to support transparent and reproducible development in the field."

    "abstract": "Detecting small objects in UAV remote sensing images and identifying surface defects in industrial inspection remain difficult tasks. These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily. We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency. We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection."

Given its wide range of applications, cross-cultural understanding capability is a crucial competency. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose SAGE, a scenario-based benchmark built via cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design, to evaluate LLMs' cross-cultural understanding and reasoning. Grounded in cultural theory, we categorize cross-cultural capabilities into nine dimensions. Using this framework, we curated 210 core concepts and constructed 4530 test items across 15 specific real-world scenarios, organized under four broader categories of cross-cultural situations, following established item design principles. The SAGE dataset supports continuous expansion, and experiments confirm its transferability to other languages. It reveals model weaknesses across both dimensions and scenarios, exposing systematic limitations in cross-cultural reasoning. While progress has been made, LLMs are still some distance away from reaching a truly nuanced cross-cultural understanding. In compliance with the anonymity policy, we include data and code in the supplement materials. In future versions, we will make them publicly available online."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a discrete inverse problem of determining three unknowns, i.e. initial displacement, initial velocity and random source term, in a fully discrete approximation of one-dimensional stochastic hyperbolic equation. We firstly prove a new Carleman estimate for the fully-discrete stochastic hyperbolic equation. Based on this Carleman estimate, we then establish a Lipschitz stability for this discrete inverse problem by the discrete spatial derivative data at the left endpoint and the measurements of the solution and its time derivative at the final time. Owing to the discrete setting, an extra term with respect to mesh size arises in the right-hand side of the stability estimate."

    "abstract": "In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of elasticity and anelasticity for bodies containing material surfaces with their own elastic energies and distributed surface eigenstrains. Bulk elasticity is written in the language of Riemannian geometry, and the framework is extended to material surfaces by using the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds. Within this setting, surface kinematics, surface strain measures, surface material metric, and the induced second fundamental form follow naturally from the embedding of the material surface in the material manifold. The classical theory of surface elasticity of Gurtin and Murdoch (1975) is revisited and reformulated in this geometric framework, and then extended to anelastic bodies with anelastic material surfaces. Constitutive equations for isotropic and anisotropic material surfaces are formulated systematically, and bulk and surface anelasticity are introduced by replacing the elastic metrics with their anelastic counterparts. The balance laws are derived variationally using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. These include the bulk balance of linear momentum together with the surface balance of linear momentum, whose normal component gives a generalized Laplace's law. As an application, we obtain the complete solution for a spherical incompressible isotropic solid ball containing a cavity filled with a compressible hyperelastic fluid, where the cavity boundary is an anelastic material surface with distributed surface eigenstrains. The analytical and numerical results quantify the effects of surface and fluid eigenstrains on the pressure-stretch response and residual stress."

    "abstract": "Visual generative models (e.g., diffusion models) typically operate in compressed latent spaces to balance training efficiency and sample quality. In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method. A thorough experimental evaluation of 50 modern deep tracking algorithms demonstrates that there is still significant room for improvement in the UAV-Anti-UAV domain. The dataset and codes will be available at {\\color{magenta}https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}."

    "abstract": "Multimodal human action recognition (HAR) leverages complementary sensors for activity classification. Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

    "abstract": "Textual explanations make image classifier decisions transparent by describing the prediction rationale in natural language. Large vision-language models can generate captions but are designed for general visual understanding, not classifier-specific reasoning. Existing zero-shot explanation methods align global image features with language, producing descriptions of what is visible rather than what drives the prediction. We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment. TEXTER identifies the neurons contributing to the prediction and emphasizes the features encoded in those neurons -- i.e., the decision-critical features. It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning. A sparse autoencoder further improves interpretability, particularly for Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments show that TEXTER generates more faithful and interpretable explanations than existing methods. The code will be publicly released."

    "abstract": "We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \\times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits."

    "abstract": "Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice."

    "abstract": "We use direct numerical simulations to investigate fluid-solid interactions in suspensions of rigid fibres settling under gravity in a quiescent fluid. The solid-to-fluid density ratio is $\\mathcal{O}(100)$, while the Galileo number ($Ga$) and fibre concentration ($n\\ell_f^3$) are varied over the ranges $Ga \\in [180, 900]$ and $n\\ell_f^3 \\in [0.36, 23.15]$; $\\ell_f$ denotes the fibre length and $n$ the number density. At high $Ga$ and/or low $n\\ell_f^3$, fibres cluster into gravity-aligned streamers with elevated concentrations and enhanced settling velocities, disrupting the flow homogeneity. As $Ga$ increases and/or $n\\ell_f^3$ decreases, the fluid-phase kinetic energy rises and the energy spectrum broadens, reflecting enhanced small-scale activity. The flow anisotropy is assessed by decomposing the energy spectrum into components aligned with and transverse to gravity. Vertical fluctuations are primarily driven by fluid-solid interactions, while transverse ones are maintained by pressure-strain effects that promote isotropy. With increasing $Ga$, nonlinear interactions become more prominent, producing a net forward energy cascade toward smaller scales, punctuated by localised backscatter events. Analysis of the local velocity gradient tensor reveals distinct flow topologies: at low $Ga$, the flow is dominated by axisymmetric compression and two-dimensional straining; at high $Ga$, regions of high fibre concentration are governed by two-dimensional strain, while voids are associated with axisymmetric extension. The fluid motion is predominantly extensional rather than rotational."

Furthermore, by repositioning the spin ensembles along the CPW, we achieve collective coupling, and demonstrate coherent energy exchange between multiple spin ensembles in the time domain. These results strongly indicate the potential of this device as a medium-scale all-to-all network structure, which is poised to advance the exploration of many-body physics and enhance coherent information processing capabilities."
